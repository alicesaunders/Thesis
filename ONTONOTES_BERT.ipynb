            "['-- basically  it was unanimously agreed upon by the various relevant parties . \\n to express its determination  the chinese securities regulatory department compares this stock reform to a die that has been cast . \\n it takes time to prove whether the stock reform can really meet expectations  and whether any deviations that arise during the stock reform can be promptly corrected . \\n dear viewers  the china news program will end here . \\n this is xu li . \\n thank you everyone for watching . \\n coming up is the focus today program hosted by E2834 shilin . \\n good-bye  dear viewers . \\n hello  dear viewers . \\n welcome to focus today . \\n today  let \\'s turn our attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in beijing over the holiday . \\n before dawn on january 3  a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of jingguang bridge  east third ring road  beijing municipality  resulting in the road caving in . \\n relevant departments from beijing municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans . \\n the traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene . \\n well  how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ? \\n after the holiday  what will be done to handle citizens \\' peak commute ? \\n in addition  what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge  heating  and communication  in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ? \\n well  we have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with us . \\n one of the two honorable guests in the studio is professor zhou hanhua from the institute of law of the chinese academy of social sciences . \\n hello . \\n next is yang yang  a host of beijing traffic radio station . \\n hello . \\n welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program . \\n well  i especially want to know  ha  how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ? \\n ah   about 11:00 m. yesterday  ah  i happened to find out through an sms when i was outside . \\n uh-huh . \\n uh-huh . \\n it happened that i was going to have lunch with a friend  um  at noon . \\n and then  the friend first sent me an sms  uh-huh . saying [he] would come pick me up to go together . \\n after that  i received an sms from 1860 . \\n uh-huh  it was through an sms . \\n and you  yang yang ? \\n a friend happened to call me . \\n you were not at work that day ? \\n no . \\n the station called me at noon and said something happened at jingguang bridge and that i had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program . \\n uh-huh  that means  er  you found out the accident through an information source at the station . \\n right  right  right . \\n uh-huh . \\n well  like professor zhou  i also received this news  ha  through a mobile phone sms . \\n at that time   it can be said that this sms was among the many  ha  sms containing new year wishes  like E6224 new year  received after the start of the new year . \\n uh-huh . \\n ah  actually i felt a lot of warmth when i received that sms . \\n although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much  i think it is very useful  ah  to inform people of this kind of news . \\n yes  exceptionally . \\n yes  exceptionally . \\n well  what in fact was the content of that sms ? \\n let \\'s take a look via this footage  ha . \\n i remember the sms was written like this at that time  saying that  ah  there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of jingguang bridge at east third ring road  and  well  traffic supervision was implemented near chaoyang road  jingguang bridge  and east third ring road  and requesting cars to make a detour . \\n some car owners said that it was very good that the sms was sent . \\n furthermore  there was one last sentence in that sms thanking citizens for their cooperation and support . \\n ah  after the sms was sent   i felt it seems to be the first time that beijing municipality  ah  used an sms to give notification at the time of a public emergency . \\n i do n\\'t know  all of us are living in beijing  is this the first time  professor zhou ? \\n yes  in terms of an official notification  this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 . \\n uh-huh . \\n of course  in private life  people have used sms countless times to spread news . \\n yes . \\n other places in the country must have used this too . \\n uh-huh  uh-huh . \\n must have used this too . \\n actually  i remember receiving an sms like this one last year before it snowed  since snowfall would affect road conditions in beijing to a rather large extent . \\n uh-huh . \\n however  it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time . \\n uh-huh . \\n ah  when an sms is sent to inform citizens of such an incident  can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ? \\n yes  this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency  ah  by beijing municipality  uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply  worthy innovation . \\n uh-huh . \\n for instance  previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods  but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone sms . \\n in fact  this is a method highly emphasized in various countries \\' development of e-government . \\n we usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable . \\n yes  when we talked about e-government in the past  it seemed to be only done through the internet . \\n right . \\n it seemed that computers  ah  and the internet  ah  were an expression of e-government  to let people find out information . \\n well  presently in fact  e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method  such as call centers  such as electronic ids  and such as  these electronic signatures . \\n these are quite sophisticated forms . \\n uh-huh . \\n in particular  more terminals  such as  this cable television  ah   this digital television  ah  and mobile phone sms  are applied in e-government . \\n hence  i think this is  a test of e-government because  as i remember  during sars in 2003  people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of sars  ah . \\n uh-huh . \\n they said that e-government was very good but was not put into use . \\n well  this time i think that a short sms like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form . \\n uh-huh . \\n yes . \\n we drive often in beijing  ha  yang yang . \\n if people were not informed of such a traffic accident through sms on that day and they continued to head there  what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ? \\n yes . \\n ah  well  i think it would have been real paralysis . \\n this is the most appropriate word to use . \\n furthermore  i think that when sms was used to announce the news  it should be said to have fit the conditions in our china very well . \\n why is that so ? \\n this is because  it should be said that china is the country with the highest sms usage . \\n there are probably not as many chances to use sms in foreign countries compared with domestically  in china  ah . \\n so  it can be said that penetration was quite high this time  by using the most familiar method  most used by everyone  as well as the most prompt and most convenient method  for the announcement . \\n yes  i noticed that many friends  around me received it . \\n it seems that almost everyone received this sms . \\n yes . \\n yes . \\n the effect was extremely good  ha . \\n so  how exactly did citizens react ? \\n let \\'s take a look at the reactions of citizens . \\n -- an sms . \\n i saw it was that jingguang bridge . \\n hey  i say  this is quite good  quite good . \\n have you received information like this before ? \\n no  no . \\n this was the first time . \\n the first time ? \\n yes  yes . \\n well  what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ? \\n quite fast . \\n really quite fast  ah . \\n so  i did not drive today . \\n i set out a bit earlier and took the subway here . \\n do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ? \\n ah  the response was quite fast . \\n in addition  various media announcements were also quite prompt . \\n colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and sms . \\n i think this plan was quite speedy . \\n it seems that through this kind of sms  citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent  ha . \\n well  apart from the  ah  point on information disclosure brought out by this accident  the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the  ah  government has also left people with a very deep impression . \\n let \\'s find out the situation at that time through some footage . \\n well  we know that after the road cave - in accident  ah  ah  traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene  ah  to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes . \\n well  lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the jingguang bridge at east third ring road . \\n all personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes  ah  have arrived at their designated locations . \\n E5763  through this footage  we see  ah  this -- \\n uh-huh . \\n okay  ah   this emergency repair worker said that [he] was there at 4 o\\'clock . \\n that means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred . \\n well  it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news . \\n well  ah  yang yang  you work at traffic radio station  ha  well  and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning . \\n a special program . \\n yes  a special program on this traffic . \\n so  let \\'s first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident . \\n judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident  as well as the eventual impact caused  what do you think are the effects ? \\n actually  concerning this  i think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in beijing . \\n previously we had a statistic  especially for the ring roads in beijing . \\n that is  if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the jingguang bridge of the third ring road  it might cause the entire third ring road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods . \\n uh-huh . \\n it might even impact traffic on the second ring road and fourth ring road . \\n well  ah  if there is an accident  from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared  it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods . \\n well  we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from jingguang bridge to changhong bridge from the south all the way to guomao bridge  blocking the main and side roads . \\n well  the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone . \\n hence  at that time  before 6:30 a .m . today  before our live broadcast  we moved the broadcast forward  and before the live broadcast we were very worried . \\n however  actually after the entire day today  i came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here  in fact  in beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control  and indeed there was a very big traffic jam . \\n uh-huh . \\n however  the affected area was not as large as expected . \\n moreover  some people made detours once they received the news . \\n right . \\n psychologically  people felt quite relieved . \\n because i know this situation . \\n right  like those whom we interviewed just now . \\n it was easy to handle once everyone understood . \\n yes  ah   a citizen  [he] said  i set out today before the incident  and i did not drive after i was informed . \\n that person did not even drive . \\n right . \\n actually  in this aspect  i think that citizens were really quite cooperative . \\n for instance  this evening  we  received an sms . \\n a friend said  i work on the 12th floor of the china world trade center at the guomao bridge  ah . \\n we were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route . \\n later on  we suggested to [him] and said  you  ah  might as well take the subway  because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the china world trade center . \\n right . \\n hey  [he] said this was quite a good idea . \\n actually  i think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect . \\n yes  many  viewers not in beijing may not be quite familiar  ah  with this road section we just mentioned  where  ah  the accident occurred . \\n ah  we can take a look later through an animation . \\n this road represents a main road on east third ring road  with problems on both the main and side roads . \\n furthermore  chaoyang road is an intersection . \\n uh-huh . \\n whether it is chaoyang road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of east third ring road in the south - north direction  as we can see from this diagram  it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of east third ring road normally has quite heavy traffic  especially during commuting times . \\n well  chaoyang road is a very important artery in the east - west direction . \\n yes . \\n when people living in the west want to cross over from the city  they have to go via this road . \\n hence  if a traffic accident occurs at this place  we can indeed imagine  ha  how widespread  ah  the extent of the impact will be  such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams . \\n yes  actually i think everyone can see that from the buses that cross jingguang bridge . \\n yes . \\n as buses that cross the third ring road are currently  right now affected by the jingguang bridge accident  ah  the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted . \\n uh-huh . \\n well  i think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes . \\n if the accident did not happen  perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many -- \\n it is really like this  just look at the bus signs . \\n right . \\n have not seen so many buses . \\n right . \\n its effect on people has been extremely extensive . \\n yes . \\n uh-huh . \\n well  what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ? \\n our correspondent specially interviewed director meng xianlong  mr. meng xianlong  of the command center of the beijing municipal traffic administration . \\n let \\'s hear what director meng said . \\n um  our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan . \\n in the roads close to where the problem emerged  we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends . \\n in this way  all vehicles going along east third ring road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides . \\n east third ring road is a traffic artery in the east of beijing that links the north and the south . \\n in order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district  we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans . \\n we set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along east second ring road  east fourth ring road  E4817 dawang road  ah  and related roads to the east and west  and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic . \\n it can be said that measures were very promptly taken . \\n ah  today is the first workday after the new year holiday . \\n well  what exactly was the situation this morning ? \\n we specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage . \\n let \\'s take a look at the situation this morning through this footage . \\n well  from this footage  we can see that  ha  at east third ring road  ah  near guanghua bridge  the roads here that lead to the vicinity of jingguang bridge have come under control and  well  various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations . \\n although the outdoor temperature in beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees  the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic  ah  and guide drivers in making detours . \\n well  since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery  the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual  with road traffic very orderly . \\n ah  it can be said  ah  yang yang  citizens  regardless of whether they took the bus or drove  their mentality  in terms of being understanding or calm  ah  was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene . \\n uh-huh . \\n right  right . \\n  through your listeners  what kind of feedback did you find out from them ? \\n actually  this morning  some listeners  ah  also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone sms . \\n since we know that jingguang bridge is located in the cbd district  well there are many office buildings  ah  a lot of them  as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work . \\n therefore  they sent sms saying  hey  it is unusual  ah  for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus . \\n well  it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning . \\n we then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing . \\n this shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency  they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind . \\n i think that this mentality in facing emergencies  in one respect shows a great change of mentality that beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past  and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations . \\n on the other hand  i think it can also fully show the level of people \\'s satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident . \\n that is  they think that the government has tried its best . \\n well  in this respect  we citizens should also contribute our efforts . \\n uh-huh . \\n as such  in this regard  i think people \\'s mentality can become very calm . \\n uh-huh . \\n well  professor zhou  from this perspective  is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ? \\n yes . \\n in terms of citizens \\' mentality . \\n yes  in fact it can be seen from this particular case . \\n that is  when the government was handling this kind of public emergency  well  it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method  well  a method in which information was quite delayed  to disclosure and transparency of information  and very fast as well . \\n we know that in the past  disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities  level by level  until the highest authorities had given approval  before information could be disclosed . \\n time was lost . \\n well  yes  the state council has  er  put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms . \\n that is  related information that can be publicized will be publicized first  in order to guide people in what to do . \\n in this way  related interaction between the government and the people can be formed . \\n that is  in modern public management  ah  this is a very good case  that is  of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people . \\n i think in fact  we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas . \\n yes  this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic . \\n traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this  cave - in accident occurred . \\n however  this accident actually involved many underground pipes  such as sewage pipes  ah  or water  ah  and gas  ah  pipes  that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects . \\n yes . \\n yang yang  do you know how many pipes there are underground ? \\n right now  there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground . \\n they include those like you just mentioned  as well as pipes like those for heating and communication  among others . \\n truly  these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens . \\n closely linked . \\n yes  therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now  people are also very concerned  ah  with the situation after the accident  with other aspects affecting citizens \\' lives . \\n let \\'s take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene . \\n ah  according to our understanding of the situation  the beijing municipal construction commission  ah  the communication commission  ah  and telecommunication  traffic  and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work . \\n relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people \\'s daily lives and work  in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period . \\n well  looking at the government \\'s response to this cave - in accident  ah  we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair  ah  because it involved various aspects of life . \\n well  ah  professor zhou  as this incident involved many departments after it took place  how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ? \\n yes . \\n this is also -- \\n it is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up . \\n yes  i think as we build this kind  er  of public  this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents  ah  has been the  most difficult to resolve  an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries . \\n how many groups of people will be sent ? \\n many groups . \\n yes  this is because social management requires division of labor in society . \\n it is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments  and in addition  a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified . \\n uh-huh . \\n how can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ? \\n well  sometimes under normal circumstances  sometimes  we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another . \\n for instance  there are too many law enforcement departments and  ah  too many administrative departments  and very often in the end  they are unable to coordinate . \\n however  this time  through the execution of emergency contingency plans by beijing municipality this time  ah  it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of beijing municipality  as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms  played a great role . \\n hence  i think this was also a kind of  er  trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms . \\n uh-huh . \\n it was a very successful  er  response . \\n i think many good things can be summed up from this . \\n yes . \\n yang yang  based on your understanding  ah  as pipes that directly affect many common people \\'s lives were damaged after the accident  based on your understanding of the situation  how was remedial work carried out ? \\n for instance  it is very cold during winter in beijing  and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently . \\n E3293  heating pipes were indeed damaged . \\n well  at the time  it affected residents living in an area of about 70 square meters of beijing . \\n well   in this regard  the chaoyang district government did a very good job . \\n after it  er  received this order from the municipal government  it immediately sent  electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area . \\n it should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday . \\n well  furthermore  in the emergency repair process  ah  it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly . \\n hence  over here  i think the municipal government  ah  including sub-district offices  made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households . \\n i think it was done in a very humanitarian manner . \\n uh-huh . \\n uh-huh . \\n professor zhou  actually for such a large scale city as beijing that has more than 14 million people  ah  for such a big city  a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common . \\n yes . \\n i think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations . \\n for instance  we see that other  er  domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents . \\n perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before . \\n this is because a city is a gathering place for modern life . \\n it is a highly civilized place  as well as  however  in fact a gathering point for various conflicts  social  economic  security  various aspects of conflict . \\n hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur . \\n the critical thing is -- \\n but the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents  and for a city  this is a test of its response capabilities . \\n yes . \\n yes . \\n yes  i think through a few incidents that happened in beijing municipality over recent years  such as sars  the snowfall a few years ago  the heavy rains two years ago  and the road cave - in at east third ring road this time  i think it can be seen that beijing municipality \\'s response capabilities continued to improve each time . \\n right . \\n it can be said that this time  what was done has received favorable comments from everyone . \\n um  well  i think  yang yang  perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect  ah . \\n yes . \\n because you often have this kind of direct sms exchange with listeners . \\n it is because  we  beijing traffic radio station  has become a part of emergency planning in beijing . \\n well  beijing traffic radio station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above . \\n well  for instance  as people still vividly remember  at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by professor zhou that people still vividly remember  there were no plans . \\n beijing municipality still had no emergency plan . \\n well  at that time  it happened that i was hosting the unblocked all the E2698 program in the studio that evening . \\n well  at that time  traffic was not at all unblocked . \\n ah  at that time there was none of this kind of interaction . \\n it was not clear  it was very congested . \\n you sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall . \\n you could find out other news only by telephone . \\n the various methods and channels were extremely unclear . \\n well  later  when we experienced that rainfall in beijing  that rainfall two years ago  as well as some days of sand storms  all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner . \\n from our perspective as media  i think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in  trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today  ah  and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications  and instructions . \\n yes  therefore  as a local media in this city  it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city . \\n yes . \\n it should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies . \\n ah  apart from this  professor zhou  what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city  especially a booming city  when handling this kind of public emergency ? \\n right  i think this gave us many revelations  ah . \\n first  i think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts . \\n this is because currently  there are  ah  frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities  ah . \\n early warnings and forecasts . \\n yes  this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism . \\n uh-huh . \\n it is not only for  this kind of sudden road cave - in  it also includes  for instance  security incidents  ah  in our society  as well as natural disasters  ah  and including public health incidents . \\n uh-huh . \\n that is  this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up . \\n uh-huh . \\n in this way  you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation  without evolving into a sudden public emergency . \\n uh-huh . \\n another thing i want to say is that besides  ah  emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms  i think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information  incident investigation  ah  and the relevant post-incident  responsibility system . \\n in fact   that is  we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect . \\n for instance  we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility . \\n we have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents  as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies  among others . \\n that is to say  we have many corresponding systems . \\n however  the question is how city management  er  handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases . \\n since we are entering new circumstances of human living  circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life  well  i think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning  early warning and forecast  emergency response  accident investigation  and accountability . \\n um  well  based on your understanding of the situation  and from an international perspective  what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ? \\n i think  in comparison to china  we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread . \\n their level of development is more advanced than ours . \\n although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year  i think  with our economic development being relatively backward  we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries . \\n for instance  many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure  public utilities industries . \\n with a background of liberalization  marketization  and privatization  how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ? \\n how can a safe  assured system be established ? \\n well  we need to learn and manage this . \\n uh-huh . \\n for instance  regarding information disclosure  well  our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast . \\n however  we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure  er  system more standardized  that is  to really implement a system of levels of responsibility . \\n well  we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and  well  how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances . \\n well  for some of our emergency contingency plans  well  ah  how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ? \\n we know that currently  many ministries and commissions  as well as people \\'s governments at the provincial level  along with those at municipal and district levels  have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies  but many of them have not been put to the test . \\n well  how will they undergo testing ? \\n these also include some of our command and policy - making systems . \\n so  with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues  ah  i think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems . \\n that is  development of future systems is one of the top current priorities . \\n how can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ? \\n the state council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan  called one plan  three systems . \\n uh-huh . \\n  one plan  refers to the contingency plan  and  three systems  refers to systems of organizations  mechanisms  and laws . \\n so  i think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations  mechanisms  and laws . \\n yes . \\n well  finally  let \\'s turn our attention to handling of the situation  ah  during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in beijing . \\n traffic  ah  can be said to have been directed  and is basically under control now . \\n well  following this  repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred  including for many pipes . \\n well  yang yang  based on your understanding  how long will it take ? \\n i think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes . \\n this is because exploration  assessment  and repair are carried out in succession . \\n therefore  regarding this work progress  to repair this road section in the shortest time  um  this will depend on the work progress . \\n uh-huh . \\n this is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone . \\n there is also an issue with many of the pipes below . \\n yes  the pipes below . \\n right  as it is winter  we know that carrying out construction during winter  especially that which requires pouring concrete and then -- \\n moreover  it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter . \\n yes  preparation mix for making it dry faster  has already been added . \\n but in the end  it requires time . \\n hence  it depends very much on factors like temperature . \\n just now  you mentioned that there are many pipes  ah  for instance  there is a key heating pipeline . \\n the first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time . \\n yes . \\n in addition  waste discharge is also very important . \\n waste discharged has currently blocked this up . \\n um  and  for instance  optical fibers  ah . \\n E3293  right now  if the optical fibers break  people in many households will not be able to watch television . \\n yes . \\n at present  we should not have a problem with watching television . \\n they are not broken . \\n it is just that  as the other pipes have to be repaired  the optical fibers have to be rearranged  to be hung up it seems . \\n after that  or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it safer to walk across this section . \\n furthermore  let \\'s take water pipes as an example . \\n because they were exposed  the water pipes were not -- \\n after that  yes  these were not damaged . \\n they were not damaged and this is quite normal . \\n um  there is no problem with water supply . \\n okay  well  today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in beijing municipality . \\n at the same time  you have also analyzed  from a system perspective  how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases . \\n okay  thank you very much  professor zhou and yang yang  for coming to the studio to participate in our program . \\n thank you  both of you . \\n okay  dear viewers  that is all for today \\'s edition of focus today . \\n thank you for watching . \\n E5763 you at the same time tomorrow . \\n hello . \\n let \\'s turn our attention to the weather . \\n today  we can use two words to summarize the weather in our country . \\n first  there will be a temperature drop over a large area  and next  there will be rainfall and snowfall in an extensive area as well . \\n we see that except for some areas of south china  southwest china  and northeast china  many other places will be experiencing temperature drops . \\n in addition  there will be snowfall in the area from northwest china to the huang - huai area through southern north china . \\n the east of southwest china  as well as the jiang - huai area and the area south of the yangtze river  will experience continuous rainfall . \\n however  southern north china and the huang - huai area will bid farewell to the snow tonight  ah . \\n tomorrow during the day  snowfall in the jiang - huai area will stop  and there will also be less snow in northwest china . \\n in addition  there will be rain throughout almost the whole of south china . \\n it can be said that there will be less snow in the north and heavier rain in the south tomorrow . \\n furthermore  temperatures tomorrow in many places south of the huai river will fall by between four and ten degrees . \\n okay  let \\'s check out the city weather forecasts . \\n beijing  overcast changing to sunny  9 degrees below zero to 2 degrees below zero . \\n harbin  sunny  26 degrees

candid stuff for a newspaper to publish about itself would n\\'t you say /? \\n well as E2204 said there are many unanswered questions /. \\n and there are many very devastating eh comments and conclusions about E5807 miller as a journalist /. \\n i do n\\'t think the times had any choice though E2229 . because remember as a press reporter back on july twenty - seventh the turmoil in the newsroom has been going on for months about E5807 miller and the way the paper has decided to cover the story and the way they decided to present [her] as a martyr for the first amendment /. \\n and

the similarities for the jayson E2103 case /. \\n remember after the jayson E2103 scandal broke we had a seven thousand word story that did not give a full account of what happened . especially about why is a major institution like the times ignoring so many red flags /. \\n alright /. \\n in the story one of things that we learn is that E5515 keller took E5807 miller off [her] wmd beat as one of [his] first personnel decisions when [he] took eh the reins as editor /. \\n alright /. \\n well uh i agree there are some unanswered questions /. \\n but i \\'m willing to give the times a little more credit than you for at least attempting to answer uh many of the questions /. \\n and E1881 dalglish here \\'s the thing that jumped out at me in the story /. \\n E5807 miller acknowledges that at E3873 E4335 \\'s request this is the E6661 cheney aide [she] agreed to refer to [him] and in stories not as a senior administration official but as a former E5331 aide because [he] had once worked on capitol E5331 /. \\n do you have a problem with that sort of thing /? \\n i thought that was a little bit misleading /. \\n and i thought it was odd /. \\n i mean [her] justification was that well [he] had been a former E5331 staffer /. \\n um but that was a strange request /. \\n and i think the agreement was strange /. \\n i \\'ll agree with you on that /. \\n E2204 sesno the times was so hamstrung by its passionate embrace of this reporter who after all was facing jail did go to jail /. \\n one can understand the emotions uh that were unleashed here /. \\n and yet the editors discouraged stories on the cia leak investigation and one time killed a piece written by a reporter about scooter E4335 /. \\n was that an abdication of journalistic responsibility /? \\n maybe yeah maybe /. \\n i mean what it really shows E2229 i think is just how difficult it is for news organizations to report on themselves /. \\n you know news organizations demand total transparency whether you \\'re general motors or united states government /. \\n we want access /. \\n we want explanation /. \\n we want full disclosure /. \\n but it \\'s very difficult for them to do it themselves /. \\n in this case and the times makes it very plain in their story today they really suffered /. \\n they were behind on virtually every major aspect of the story /. \\n even when [she] went to jail /? \\n even when [she] went to jail and w- /. \\n when [she] won release from jail /. \\n yeah at the point that [she] came out /. \\n they did n\\'t say that you know until [she] walked out /. \\n and the question and this is a very serious question it \\'s not answered in the article /. \\n were editorial higher - ups and were the corporate lawyers at the new york times in some way leaning on suppressing and distorting the coverage from the news uh section /? \\n arianna huffington uh in this lengthy piece this morning uh uh E5807 miller is quoted excuse me as saying that there was another source beside scooter E4335 that [she] dealt with on the E6956 plame situation /. \\n [she] does n\\'t recall who that source was looking at [her] notes and seeing the uh notation E6956 flame /. \\n [she] got the name wrong /. \\n do you buy this notion that [she] does n\\'t recall who this other source was /? \\n no of course not E2229 /. \\n in fact i think this is the major unanswered question /. \\n we do n\\'t know who eh [her] source was when it comes to revealing the identity of E6956 plame /. \\n and to say that [she] does not recall is really as convincing as having woodward and bernstein saying that they do not recall who deep throat was /. \\n after all these notes were just a few weeks old when um the E6956 plame E720 novak column appeared and when the whole E4477 and the whole journalistic community was talking about it /. \\n you know i do n\\'t /- \\n incidentally there was some questions uh that E5807 miller would not answer to [her] colleagues /. \\n and [she] would n\\'t share [her] notes with them although they \\'ve been turned over to the special prosecutor /. \\n E1881 dalglish the big news for me was miller recounting what [her] lawyer E2136 abrams had said to [her] about a conversation that [he] had with E1048 E1936 who was scooter E4335 \\'s lawyer /. \\n uh says um E2136 abrams according to miller \\'s account when i would n\\'t give [him] E1936 an assurance that you would exonerate E4335 [he] said do n\\'t go there /. \\n now E1936 by the way tells the times that that account is false and outrageous /. \\n does this help justify eh E5807 miller \\'s otherwise mysterious decision to go to jail and not accept the waiver of confidentiality that scooter E4335 offered and sit in jail for eighty - five days /? \\n n- you n- /. \\n you know i \\'ve been talking to E5807 off and on about this case for the last year /. \\n this was a very difficult decision /. \\n and you know what this all comes down to is you keep your promises when you make a promise to a confidential source /. \\n you \\'ll recall six or eight months ago E2229 i was on the show and we were talking about you know did russert and kessler and all the rest of those guys did they break some trust by agreeing to testify and observing the waiver /? \\n what i think this situation and the turmoil that is obviously going on at the times right now points out is the fact that we have a major problem in this country /. \\n it \\'s that reporters believe they need to keep their promises to their sources /. \\n reporters will try to do whatever they can as long as the law allows them to protect those sources /. \\n right /. \\n but these days um with the state of our law the fact that we do not have a federal shield law we have prosecutors and civil litigants going in there and interfering with the day to day operation of our newsrooms /. \\n and we just can tolerate this /. \\n and we \\'re trying to /- \\n i think E1881 \\'s on to something here if i can just say E2229 /. \\n and i think this is very important because this is an ugly case /. \\n and even people close to E3991 miller say this is not the one you \\'d really like to go to the mat on /. \\n you \\'d love to have a clear whistle blower case /. \\n you \\'d love to have a pentagon papers case /. \\n you \\'d love to have something where the well - being and the sanctity of the republic you know hangs in the balance /. \\n [she] did n\\'t even report on this /. \\n but it does point out a very serious issue /. \\n and that is the whole notion of the use of and abuse of confidential sources the protections that reporters do or do n\\'t have and the propensity of uh the united states government to have more secrecy not less /. \\n we \\'ve got to figure this out /. \\n well just to clarify uh [she] did ultimately uh testify about [her] confidential source /. \\n the whole issue was how voluntary was the waiver of [her] promise to scooter E4335 offered and why was [she] able to accept after being in jail as opposed to before being in jail /. \\n well exactly /. \\n and you know what E2229 /. /. \\n it \\'s really time for E1881 and other E5807 miller defenders to update [her] talking points because what E1881 just said just simply does not wash /. \\n the truth is that as E2229 said [she] did testify /. \\n the truth is that it \\'s very clear from the stories today that [she] could \\'ve asked uh scooter E4335 to call [her] so that [she] could hear the timber of [his] voice earlier /. \\n all of that could have happened /. \\n it did not happen because clearly E5807 miller is protecting another source that [she] still has not revealed to the american public /. \\n and the new york times is /. \\n E1881 /. \\n /. \\n let me get a response from E1881 dalglish /. \\n i think it \\'s very obvious from what E5807 wrote today [she] is protecting somebody else /. \\n and one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was [she] negotiating what [she] was going to say about scooter E4335 but you got to keep in mind i \\'m a lawyer there were lawyers involved in this /. \\n they had to negotiate with E2481 E4562 what [he] would not talk about /. \\n they also had to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um uh uh obstruction charges connected with contacting /. \\n once you invoke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have to be very very careful /. \\n you do n\\'t mess with the feds /. \\n it \\'s very clear in [her] story that [she] decided finally to testify because [she] got tired of jail because [she] was threatened with criminal contempt charges because [she] wanted to go out and now [she] \\'s saying admitting finally write a book /. \\n all these things are there in black and white /. \\n and to continue to portray [her] as a martyr is not going to work /. \\n and on that point arianna on that point [she] says sh- /- \\n excuse me /. \\n E5807 miller says [she] \\'s taking some time off from the paper /. \\n [she] wants to write a book /. \\n [she] would n\\'t share [her] notes with [her] colleagues who were writing the story /. \\n do you think [she] \\'ll ever come back /? \\n you think [she] \\'s saving it for the book /? \\n well it \\'s very clear that [she] would not be welcome in the newsroom /. \\n and it \\'s very clear eh as i reported again that when E5515 keller took [her] off [her] wmd beat they were all hoping [she] would resign /. \\n instead [she] threw a fit /. \\n but [she] stayed on /. \\n this is not a journalism one oh one course the way [she] handled both the wmd reporting and plame gate /. \\n E2204 sesno please comment /. \\n jump in /. \\n and E2229 i \\'ll tell you what /. \\n this is a gigantic shot across the bow of every manager in the news business and every editor and every executive producer anywhere because you got to have some uh control some connection with your correspondants and your reporters /. \\n you got to know who they \\'re talking to at some level anyway because you know what /? \\n it \\'s about trust with the public /. \\n and it \\'s about you know ending up in jail or in court /. \\n their story says that E5515 keller and E3538 sulzberger did not press E5807 miller about [her] conversations with E4335 or ask to see [her] notes while they were defending [her] /. \\n ask to see [her] /. \\n and by the way we invited the new york times to have an editor appear on this program /. \\n the paper declined /. \\n when we come back media speculation run amuck over possible indictments at sixteen hundred pennsylvania and the president \\'s scripted session with troops in iraq /. \\n stay with us /. \\n welcome back to reliable sources /. \\n as the cia leak investigation continued this week media folks did plenty of speculating with no evidence about the possible indictment of a certain top white house official who testified before the grand jury for the fourth time on friday /. \\n E2566 rove [his] closest aide the number two man in the white house the man that has been called bush \\'s brain /. \\n if [he] \\'s indicted and has to go it undermines the key source of this president \\'s public support [his] character /. \\n if rove gets indicted that could bring down the bush administration i think /. \\n my understanding from talking to somebody quite close to this investigation is that they think there are going to be indictments /. \\n and possibly E2566 rove could be among them /. \\n E1881 dalglish if E2566 rove is indicted  if E2566 rove is indicted  what if [he] \\'s not indicted /? \\n is n\\'t this the worst kind of journalistic speculation /? \\n yeah /. \\n you know i think it \\'s always dangerous to speculate whether or not you \\'re really besmirching someone \\'s reputation . although i \\'m not sure you can do that with E2566 rove /. \\n but it uh is very very you know eh irre- /- \\n i would prefer that people keep an eye on you know watching [him] testify and going in and out of the courthouse /. \\n but uh will it bring down the administration /? \\n i do n\\'t know /. \\n ah eh i do n\\'t know /. \\n well nobody knows /. \\n that \\'s the point /. \\n arianna huffington i used to cover the justice department /. \\n not everybody who \\'s under investigation winds up getting indicted /. \\n ah but you certainly and you \\'re uh on a blog so maybe it \\'s a different standard have speculated about rove \\'s fate as well /. \\n well not just rove though /. \\n what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that E4562 is after the whole iraq white house group the group that uh in cheney \\'s office with E4335 and rove and E4226 matalin and condoleezza E423 and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the american public based on lies /. \\n i mean that is really the web /. \\n but it seems and we find out today also from uh um the reporting on the miller story  that uh E4562 is after cheney even in some of the questioning eh of miller /. \\n i think those were fairly routine questions about /. \\n you have E5807 miller there /. \\n you ask about cheney /. /. \\n [he] was being thorough /. \\n i think we \\'re overthinking this whole thing /. \\n E2566 rove and this speculation business you know /. \\n E2204 sesno /. \\n E2515 E4562 /. \\n it \\'s very easy to sit here and say oh we should never speculate in journalism /. \\n it \\'s irresponsible journalism /. \\n it \\'s really how you speculate not that you speculate /. \\n the fact of the matter is that E2566 rove has been to the grand jury four times /. \\n the fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in E4477 and believe me they \\'re not all journalists who are speculating what if the guy gets indicted /. \\n it would be irresponsible i think for the media not to reflect what the discussion is here in town /. \\n and there are plenty of republicans mostly republicans who are worried about this /. \\n alright i want to turn now to uh president bush \\'s uh meeting uh uh photo op some called it with us troops in iraq whether it was staged how shocking that would be /. \\n let \\'s take a look at the actual footage /. \\n and in your interactions with the iraqi civilians in tikrit E2809 \\'s hometown how are they reacting to this political process /? \\n sir in the north central area of iraq voter registration has increased seventeen percent /. \\n can you give us a sense for the reception of the people there in tikrit /? \\n sir in north central iraq voter regis- /- \\n are you stunned /? \\n are you stunned /? \\n shocked /. \\n i ca n\\'t believe it /. \\n they rehearsed it /. \\n they rehearsed it /. \\n they rehearsed it /. \\n yeah you know something /? \\n uh i remember a long time ago E5324 deaver the ultimate image meister for E1305 E4860 said my job is to light the president well and for everything i do to put the president in a good light /. \\n now look first of all this is uncomfortable to see /. \\n and what the problem this now creates for the white house is {is} it plays into the credibility issue that the president has that everything now is becoming a photo op and a rehearsed event in order to rescue what are tumbling numbers on [his] performance on public support of iraq the whole bit /. \\n but the fact that anybody would think that you would do something like this a remote /. \\n i mean anybody in television will tell you that \\'s complicated business /. \\n you have satellite delay /. \\n you have a half a dozen people sitting there /. \\n who \\'s going to speak when /. \\n you do n\\'t want awkward silences /. \\n you \\'re going to walk through it /. \\n so that it happened does n\\'t surprise me /. \\n that it hurts the president yeah that \\'s inevitable too /. \\n arianna huffington does the staging here surprise you at all /? \\n well it \\'s not the question of surpising me E2229 /. \\n it \\'s the fact that we are talking about war /. \\n this is not just any photo opportunity /. \\n of course that \\'s part and parcel of the presidency /. \\n but we \\'re talking about a war in which almost two thousand young americans have died /. \\n and we are also using soldiers as props /. \\n yes it is shocking /. \\n and i think E5908 olbermann did a phenomenal job at exposing this on msnbc /. \\n alright /. \\n and i think more and more journalists are actually taking a hard look at what this administration is doing /. \\n and we \\'ll have to leave it there /. \\n last word /. \\n arianna huffington E1881 dalglish in minneapolis E2204 sesno thanks so very much for joining us /. \\n coming up  we launch our new segment talk back to the media /. \\n president E6074 \\'s former lawyer E5749 E2797 takes on sixty minutes and ex-fbi director E3873 freeh /. \\n and still to come new york times columnist E6408 friedman /. \\n welcome back /. \\n in our new talk back to the media segment someone who believes [he] or [she] \\'s been treated unfairly by the press gets the chance to sound off and give their side of the controversy /. \\n last sunday E4637 E3038 sat down with E3873 freeh who \\'s peddling a memoir on sixty minutes /. \\n and the former fbi director unloaded on the president who appointed [him] E5515 E6074 /. \\n among [his] criticisms the former president \\'s handling of the nineteen ninety - six khobar towers terrorist bombing that killed nineteen us marines in saudi arabia /. \\n i was very disappointed that the political leadership of the united states uh would tell the families of these nineteen heroes that we were going to leave no stone unturned and find the people who killed them /. \\n to give that order to the director because that \\'s the order that i got and then to do nothing to assist and facilitate that investigation in fact to undermine it /. \\n the E6074 people were furious at the way sixty minutes hailed the segment /. \\n and here to talk back is former E6074 white house attorney E5749 E2797 /. \\n welcome /. \\n let \\'s deal with the substance first /. \\n E3873 freeh says that when E6074 met with crown E6866 E1383 in nineteen ninety - eight  [he] did n\\'t press for fbi access to suspects in the khobar towers bombing and [he] hit up the prince for a contribution to [his] presidential library /. \\n well not only is that false and president E6074 has said so but everybody who attended the meeting not including E3873 freeh says it \\'s false /. \\n and my problem with sixty minutes is that they never called anybody at the meeting /. \\n until friday afternoon we did n\\'t even know the charge was being made /. \\n and even then they were unwilling to put somebody on the air to contradict mister freeh /. \\n sixty minutes says E5515 E6074 was offered a chance to come on and give [his] rebuttal /. \\n what \\'s wrong with that /? \\n well first of all it \\'s absolutely amazing that sixty minutes thinks it \\'s okay to air a false and malicious statement /. \\n this is a terrible charge that an fbi investigation was thwarted because president E6074 wanted to receive money for [his] library /. \\n the charge was false /. \\n and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the united states /? \\n what about anybody at the meeting who was willing to be on /? \\n what about them doing reporting themselves before they air a false and demonstrably false charge /? \\n that \\'s my problem /. \\n what about E5808 berger the former national security advisor under president E6074 /? \\n [he] was at the meeting /. \\n [he] was in the room /. \\n did you offer [him] for an on - camera interview /? \\n well on friday afternoon /. \\n you were n\\'t there /. \\n i was not there /. \\n you \\'re good on television /. \\n but you were n\\'t there /. \\n uh i talked to E5808 berger /. \\n we issued a statement from mister berger /. \\n but this was friday afternoon when we first learned about it with sunday broadcast /. \\n why did n\\'t sixty minutes invite mister berger or other people at the meeting before friday afternoon /? \\n why did it take us to get sixty minutes to do basic reporting to verify facts /? \\n it \\'s not enough to have E3873 freeh say something is so based on an anonymous source /. \\n that \\'s poor journalism /. \\n on that point let me read a statement from a sixty minutes spokesman /. \\n and this involves uh their saying that they contacted E6074 \\'s office back in E4684 with a detailed list of charges and then quote in subsequent phone calls the president \\'s people said [he] did not want to be interviewed /. \\n they gave no +substantive response to any of the allegations until E5749 E2797 launched [his] pr campaign on the thursday before the broadcast and offered himself as the person from the camp who would merely disparage and attack freeh rather than deal with [his] allegations /. \\n denials from president E6074 and E5808 berger that did deal with freeh \\'s allegations were included in the sixty minutes report /. \\n well first of all it \\'s false to say that i was asking to disparage freeh /. \\n i was asking to talk about facts that freeh was saying that were not true /. \\n you do n\\'t mind disparaging freeh /. \\n my observation /. \\n no in fact i disparage any man who as fbi director has a personal pique rather than doing [his] job /. \\n that \\'s disparaging /. \\n secondly it is absolutely a misrepresentation that they told us before just the week before /. \\n when mister E7563 the representative spoke to mister E3038 mister E3038 agreed that they had never verified what mister uh freeh had said /. \\n they never talked to mister freeh /. \\n and in fact it was n\\'t until that friday that we learned the substance of mister freeh \\'s charges /. \\n so sixty minutes i think has just said something that is false /. \\n when did the E6074 team find out that sixty minutes was going to report that E3873 freeh with [his] new book was going to have a specific allegation about E6074 \\'s handling of the khobar towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation /. \\n when somebody named E3713 kurtz wrote a story in the E4477 post on friday morning is the first time that the E6074 forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that mister freeh made a false charge /. \\n and even since that interview mister freeh has backed off and has not told people who [his] source is /. \\n and [he] has n\\'t even insisted that it was true /. \\n [he] just said somebody told [him] it was true /. \\n hold on /. \\n sixty minutes spokesman E6241 tedesco said in the statement i just referred to that the E6074 office was contacted in E4684 with a detailed list of charges /. \\n that \\'s false /. \\n are you saying that \\'s false /? \\n they were never told /. /. \\n or at least i \\'m now basing this on what mister E7563 has told me /. \\n E7165 E7563 is the spokesman for former president E5515 E6074 /. \\n E7165 E7563 is the spokesperson for president E6074 was not informed about the specific charge about the khobar towers which happens to be not true /. \\n president E6074 at that uh meeting did press the uh crown E6866 to cooperate with the fbi /. \\n so what mister freeh said was false /. \\n that was not understood by the E6074 people until it was read in the E4477 post in the story that you wrote because sixty minutes put a press release out /. \\n uh now look E5749 E2797 sixty minutes gave E5515 E6074 one hour last year to push [his] own ten million dollar autobiography /. \\n [he] criticized people /. \\n [he] criticized E6694 E93 /. \\n they did n\\'t have E6694 E93 on to rebut /. \\n now the former director of the federal bureau of investigation uh who ca n\\'t stand E6074 clearly writes a book gets one segment for [his] book /. \\n and you cry foul /. \\n nobody was complaining about when E5515 E6074 was getting all this airtime on cbs /. \\n look /. \\n look this is a program about good journalism /. \\n let \\'s ask a sixty minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former fbi director as whether it \\'s true or not /. \\n is it good enough to air it just because [he] says it /. \\n or should you do reporting /? \\n good reporters would hear that charge and say that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president E6074 /. \\n let \\'s see whether it \\'s true and start making phone calls /. \\n they did not do that /. \\n that \\'s a fact /. \\n alright E5749 E2797 thanks very much for coming on to talk back to the media this morning /. \\n we appreciate it /. \\n ahead in the second half of reliable sources new york times columnist E6408 friedman on whether the media are suffering from iraq fatigue /. \\n plus that heavily hyped subway threat that was n\\'t /. \\n after an update on the hour \\'s top stories from E4056 /. \\n hello i \\'m at the cnn center in E4056 /. \\n now in the news /. \\n earthquake relief flights have resumed in pakistan /. \\n that \\'s after torrential rain stopped flights for hours there /. \\n and a pakistani helicopter crashed killing six soldiers /. \\n a magnitude seven point six earthquake struck last weekend as you recall /. \\n pakistan \\'s prime minister says it killed at least thirty - eight thousand people and left about two and a half million homeless /. \\n toledo ohio is quiet this morning after a planned march by a self - styled nazi group sparked a riot yesterday /. \\n the associated press says police arrested at least sixty - five people /. \\n the march never got started /. \\n but hundreds of counter-demonstrators showed up and battled police on and off for more than three hours /. \\n police say the protestors vandalized vehicles and buildings setting at least one structure on fire /. \\n look at this /. \\n a semi-truck and a bus carrying high school band members collided overnight on interstate ninety - four and in wisconsin /. \\n the associated press quotes the wisconsin state patrol as saying at least five people were killed /. \\n the students were from chippewa falls wisconsin /. \\n they were returning from a band competition at the university of wisconsin in whitewater /. \\n those are the headlines this morning /. \\n i \\'m in E4056 /. \\n we have another news update coming up in just thirty minutes /. \\n more of cnn \\'s reliable sources continues right now /. \\n welcome back to the second half of reliable sources /. \\n our new time for those of you just turning in is ten am eastern seven on the west coast /. \\n and we \\'ll be bringing you a full hour of media interviews and analysis each week /. \\n the iraq story which the media has placed on the back burner in recent months is simmering again as voters in that war torn country went to the polls yesterday to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted /. \\n but are journalists getting the real story there /? \\n to help us scrutinize the coverage i sat down with a foreign affairs columnist of the new york times three time pulitzer winner E6408 friedman and the author most recently of the world is flat /. \\n E6408 friedman welcome /. \\n good to be here E2229 /. \\n thank you /. \\n the other day you wrote that if you were the editor of the new york times you would \\'ve led the paper with the news of recent days that a sunni suicide bomber on ramadan had attacked a shiite mosque /. \\n now in reality the world that you do n\\'t rule new york times E4477 post made that part of a larger story on iraq /. \\n uh nobody put it on the front page /. \\n bad news judgement /? \\n uh i think so E2229 /. \\n i \\'m not here to make a news point though /. \\n i \\'m really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism /. \\n i \\'m a firm believer /. \\n how we ever going to win this war /? \\n we \\'re never going to win it by way of american intelligence finding this terrorist or that terrorist /. \\n we get lucky every once in a while /. \\n but there \\'s only {one?} way we win this war E2229 is it takes a village /. \\n it only happens when the sunni muslim world basically turns people in and when the sunni muslim world restrains their own /. \\n and what was so shocking to me about this story a sunni jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of ramadan /. \\n what that tells you is that there \\'s no controlling moral authority today in the sunni muslim world /. \\n well what is the bigger story /? \\n and that is a huge story /. \\n i think it should have been a big story /. \\n why was n\\'t /- \\n is it because of iraq fatigue /? \\n um /. \\n i think it is yeah /. \\n think it \\'s /- \\n are all the editors and producers and new executives feeling another day another bombing ten killed twenty killed fifteen killed /. \\n and it does n\\'t rise anymore to the top of the newscast or the front page /? \\n right /. \\n yeah and i think that \\'s right /. \\n there is iraq fatigue /. \\n and there \\'s so much fatigue that we do n\\'t sit back and say wait a minute /. \\n what happened today /? \\n a sunni muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of ramadan their holiest day /. \\n and no one says boo /. \\n this is civilization that when we accidentally or deliberately i do n\\'t know abused the koran people rioted in pakistan /. \\n yet their own houses of worship and holidays are being defiled /. \\n and i think it is a measure of how much we \\'ve kind of lost been numbed by all of this that we do n\\'t sit back and say wow wait a minute /. \\n that really crosses the line /. \\n and we have to call them on it even if they do n\\'t /. \\n you \\'re recently back from iraq /. \\n and you write about driving in from kuwait /. \\n you were guarded by the us navy /. \\n and yet it was kind of a harrowing experience /. \\n why so /? \\n um you know the south of iraq which is where i was the area around /. \\n this is the safe part /. \\n right exactly /. \\n i was in the safe district /. \\n i was guarded uh by the british E5721 marines actually because unfortunately they \\'ve had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs /. \\n and it \\'s part of the general continuing insecurity of iraq that um i \\'m afraid has plagued this story from the very beginning /. \\n and it \\'s been i \\'ve always felt the achille \\'s heel /. \\n you know my criticism of the bush administration as you know we \\'ve talked about this before is not that this war is not important /. \\n i believe it is important much more important than i think the left has ever fully recognized /. \\n but it \\'s so much harder than the right has ever been willing to acknowledge /. \\n and on that trip you put on body armor /. \\n their rifles were out /. \\n yeah /. \\n um how does that affect your perception as a journalist /? \\n you \\'re there /. \\n you \\'re being protected /. \\n and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there /. \\n well i \\'ll tell you what \\'s really frustrating from a journalist \\'s point of view as one who have lived in beirut for nearly five years covered that war /. \\n when i worked in lebanon you could go anywhere on that story /. \\n you could cross lines /. \\n journalists worked for the most part until the very end with E7084 anderson the kidnappings targets /. \\n therefore by the end of the lebanon story i thought the best journalists there knew more than the lebanese /. \\n i always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the lebanese something they did n\\'t know because you were moving around so much /. \\n what \\'s so frustrating about the iraq story E2229 no one has a bird \\'s eye view /. \\n i care passionately about this story /. \\n i \\'m so interested in it /. \\n but because of the securtiy situation you ca n\\'t move around with the freedom you want /. \\n and the brave reporters who are there every day do n\\'t have that freedom of movement either /. \\n and therefore it \\'s limited /. \\n and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /. \\n there \\'s a lot of good things going on in iraq /. \\n there \\'s a lot of progress being made we \\'re not seeing reported by the press /. \\n do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /? \\n no because i do n\\'t have a bird \\'s eye view /. \\n i wish i could say /. \\n i wish i could be so sure /. \\n but general E3519 does n\\'t have a bird \\'s eye view /. \\n and that \\'s why we get surprises in iraq /. \\n uh that \\'s why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out /. \\n and maybe you know we \\'re going to see more surpises in the coming future there /. \\n but because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n\\'t have that bird \\'s eye view /. \\n and as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story i find that really frustra- /- \\n i can not report it the way i \\'d love to /. \\n so i \\'ve been there five times /. \\n but it \\'s episodic /. \\n it \\'s here /. \\n it \\'s there /. \\n it \\'s never really putting your arms around the story /. \\n pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you \\'d have to say that the iraq story has been overshadowed by E6771 by E934 by E6408 delay by E3861 miers by E6956 plame and now by this pakistan earthquake /. \\n um inevitable with a war that drags on and on /. \\n and these are all also important stories obviously /. \\n but uh do you feel it \\'s getting the attention that it should /? \\n yeah /. \\n no because to me this is the whole ballgame of the bush administration /. \\n E6771 and E934 they \\'ll come and go /. \\n but at the end of the day the bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /. \\n if that happens then i think president bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in [his] uh legacy there /. \\n um if it does n\\'t happen i think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /. \\n so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the american people /. \\n these are huge stakes involved /. \\n and so i do n\\'t think it \\'s gotten the attention it \\'s deserved /. \\n and going back again to one of your iraq collumns uh you observed the iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /. \\n the slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the us and british advisors out tomorrow the whole iraqi navy would collapse /. \\n that \\'s a pretty pessimistic assessment and clearly at odds with what the white house and the defense department say every day /. \\n /. \\n not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration /. \\n so you \\'re saying there \\'s a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record /. \\n you quoted one us senior official and what the president of the united states and the vice president and the secretary of defense are saying to reporters every day /. \\n are we calling them on that /? \\n right i do n\\'t think enough because there \\'s been a lot of happy talk around this E2229 basically /. \\n and a lot of numbers are thrown out /. \\n eighty thousand this week we \\'ve got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week /. \\n here \\'s what you learn when you go to iraq /. \\n where you have an iraqi commander who \\'s a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit /. \\n and where you do n\\'t have that commander you do n\\'t have a unit /. \\n so the numbers the macro numbers do n\\'t mean anything /. \\n so i went down to see the navy there /. \\n the navy of iraq has a terrific commander /. \\n so the people around [him] they \\'ll follow [him] into battle /. \\n but you take that one guy out there \\'s no iraqi navy /. \\n and it \\'s true of units all over the country /. \\n that \\'s really the key /. \\n you say that you are angry uh that bush has fought the war as though it would be easy /. \\n are you particularly angry as somebody who supported the war and took heat from some of your liberal friends for doing so /? \\n yes /. \\n absolutely because i believe this is important /. \\n i believe that something very big is at stake /. \\n we \\'re dealing with a muslim arab civilization right now that \\'s that \\'s in decline  that \\'s heading in the wrong direction in ways that are dangerous for them and i believe dangerous for the stability of the world /. \\n there \\'s something really important here at stake /. \\n and what makes me so angry at the bush administration is not that they did n\\'t frame the stakes /. \\n it is important /. \\n but they never never appreciated how difficult it was /. \\n they never prepared the army or the american people for how difficult it was /. \\n i mentioned the uh devastating earthquake in pakistan a region you \\'re familiar with /. \\n um clearly it \\'s become a pretty big story /. \\n but for the first couple days i noticed it was n\\'t that much of a television story /. \\n and the reason was no pictures no video /. \\n no yes /. \\n um but also maybe there was there a little bit less coverage because it \\'s in a remote part of the world /? \\n uh westerners are more interested in new orleans than in pakistan /? \\n i think all of the above /. \\n we \\'re so numbed also after E6771 and E934 /. \\n and now another earthquake /. \\n /. \\n it \\'s just become uh one natural disaster after another /. \\n to hear ten thousand twenty thousand forty thousand then it \\'s almost hard for a journalist to process /. \\n right /. \\n and it was remote /. \\n and people are exhausted i think both viewers and reporters /. \\n ahead have new york times columnists been asked not to write about E5807 miller /? \\n more of my interview with E6408 friedman next /. \\n welcome back to reliable sources now a full hour each week here in our new time slot ten to eleven o\\'clock eastern /. \\n more now of my conversation with new york times columnist E6408 friedman about [his] book the new online charge to read [him] and E5807 miller /. \\n now your new book the world is flat i \\'ve got it here /. \\n uh monster best seller more than a million copies better than any book you \\'ve ever written before /. \\n um you were recently profiled about this in E318 magazine /. \\n and uh let \\'s just say that it did n\\'t say you walked on water but it came close /. \\n uh but one of the criticisms /- \\n what \\'s wrong with that /? \\n it says that you \\'re the composer of the nation \\'s talking points which was news to me /. \\n uh one of the things it said was that uh in your book and in your writing that ceos play a very central role /. \\n and the suggestion was well ceos love you  you \\'re asked to speak at all these corporate events  maybe because you give them a very large uh share of the narrative /. \\n yeah /. \\n mhm /. \\n mhm /. \\n that a reasonable observation /? \\n yeah it is a reasonable observation /. \\n and my reaction to that is look if i want to understand the underlying technology that is flattening the world who do i go to /? \\n do i go to i do n\\'t know central america /? \\n do i go to um uh the factory floor /? \\n or do i go to the innovators and entrepeneurs who actually put all this together /? \\n so i make no apology for that at all /. \\n um fact i would make a criticism of it /. \\n there are n\\'t enough people during the last few years who actually went out and talked to the innovators who are doing all of these things who are actually reshaping the world /. \\n just the opposite /. \\n we kind of had an enron effect /. \\n and enron effect was all ceos are guilty unless proven innocent  therefore who wants to talk to them /? \\n and therefore i would argue -- /. \\n E687 a second /. \\n wait a second /. \\n journalists uh subscribe to stereotypes because there are a few crooks at major corporations because you know they \\'re all bad guys /? \\n yeah yeah /. \\n yeah i would say /. \\n uh that \\'s a harsh uh assessment /. \\n i would say that there \\'s several things happened basically in the last three years /. \\n i would call it a perfect storm /. \\n one was nine eleven /. \\n that distracted us okay /. \\n the other was the enron effect /. \\n you know no one wanted to be sort of seen with ceos /. \\n and number three was the dot com bust which made everyone think well all this globalization technology stuff is really over /. \\n and as a result i would argue that really masked what is actually a fundemental inflection point the flattening of the world that we \\'re going from a vertical value creation model of command and control to a much more horizontal one of connect and collaborate /. \\n the argument of this book is that that shift is actually going to have as big an effect over time as gutenberg and the printing press /. \\n and i would argue a little bit that it got missed because of all these other distractions /. \\n but it \\'s only had an effect on E6408 friedman \\'s career /. \\n in fact you were the playboy interview /. \\n hey put that paper down /. \\n /. \\n i bought it for the articles /. \\n uh i enjoyed the interview /. \\n and you said in there that your wife uh edits all your columns and [she] says do n\\'t publish it /. \\n yes [she] does /. \\n you go back and rewrite it /. \\n i \\'m afraid i do /. \\n /. \\n my wife E1312 edits them all /. \\n and when [she] gives me thumbs down E2229 i have to put it in a ball throw it in the circular file and start over /. \\n and [she] \\'s a tough editor /. \\n now your international readership on the new york times website has gone down because of this new experiment the times has where it costs forty nine ninety - five a year for non-subscribers at home to read times columnists /. \\n that \\'s got to be disappointing for you /. \\n you know um i \\'m torn /. \\n uh and i \\'ve said this to my bosses /. \\n um i want my paper to thrive /. \\n and if we have a situation where young people grow up in the world that thinks that newspapers are things you read for free online who \\'s going to pay my travel expenses /? \\n and at the same time one of the greatest things about new york times online is i got to reach an audience that just was exponential to what you got in the dead tree edition of the new york times /. \\n and because i write about international affairs so i got a lot of young people in india and egypt and whatnot /. \\n and for them fifty dollars that may be their tuition for half a year /. \\n so i \\'m honestly torn /. \\n i really hope this works because i want the new york times to have a platform that is sustainable /. \\n but at the same time i hope we can eventually find a way to re-engage those people because definitely we \\'ve lost some of them /. \\n eh in the E6956 plame leak investigation there \\'s an allegation bouncing around the blogosphere that i just thought i would address with you which is have new york times columnists somehow been told not to write about this because of E5807 miller \\'s involvement and being in jail  now being out of jail /. \\n absolutely not /. \\n anybody tell you not to write about it /? \\n i mean they do n\\'t tell me not to write about anything /. \\n E2229 we are home alone okay /. \\n i mean i \\'m going to china uh on monday /. \\n and there \\'s only one person knows i \\'m going /. \\n and that \\'s my assistant /. \\n so um /- \\n did you even tell the boss /? \\n that \\'s right /. so there \\'s no edict out there /. \\n why people have n\\'t written about it i do n\\'t know /. \\n i \\'m focused on other things /. \\n there \\'s a lot we do n\\'t know obviously about the E3991 miller situation /. \\n but why do you think that [she] has gotten so much criticism /? \\n after all whether you agree with [her] or not this is a woman who believed in [her] convictions and went off to jail for eighty - five days /. \\n um you know um E5807 \\'s always been a pioneer and an agent of change you know um and uh has been at the forefront of a lot of stories /. \\n and people like that in our business um uh engender a lot of attention a lot of criticism and a lot of jealousy /. \\n um and uh that \\'s the only way i can really explain /. \\n E6408 friedman /. \\n up next did the media get carried away with last week \\'s subway terror alert /? \\n we \\'ll ride the rails into the spin cycle next /. \\n when new york mayor E4637 bloomberg announced last week that there was a possible terror threat against the city \\'s subways i thought here we go again /. \\n and television was all over the story /. \\n here in new york tonight officials say they are increasing security on the city \\'s massive subway system because of what they call a significant and credible threat /. \\n the threat to attack the subways in coming days comes from overseas /. \\n and the police here will be searching bags briefcases even baby strollers to try to stop it /. \\n it was let \\'s face it irresistable /. \\n and since it was right there in the big apple cable anchors and correspondents could provide almost non-stop on the scene coverage /. \\n the threat concerns the new york city subway system behind me around me literally beneath our feet here in times square /. \\n the E2117 news alert new york city subways are on a heightened state of alert this evening after what officials are describing as a specific threat /. \\n and the city \\'s tabloids were n\\'t far behind /. \\n the problem as with so many previous terror alerts is that allegations from informants are inherently shaky /. \\n and some correspondents offered caveats of course /. \\n msnbc anchor E5908 olbermann could n\\'t help but notice on that day october six it was news that E2566 rove had been called back to testify in the cia leak case and the white house is being assailed by conservatives over the E3861 miers nomination /. \\n events that have been politically disadvantageous to the current administration have been uh occuring simultaneously or followed quickly upon with something related to terrorism on a big scale /. \\n by the next morning the new york times and the E4477 post were reporting that federal authorities were playing down the threat as noncredible /. \\n but the tv coverage kept rolling down the track like the number four express /. \\n finally last E3030 some newspapers and then the cable networks reported that the whole thing was a hoax /. \\n the cbs evening news gave that three sentences /. \\n well E1796 E2733 of our E4477 bureau quotes government sources tonight as saying the iraqi man who gave that tip to us intelligence agents in iraq now says the information was simply not true /. \\n but that \\'s a lot more than nbc nightly news and abc \\'s world news tonight which did n\\'t mention the great subway hoax at all /. \\n in an age of terror such threats obviously need to be reported /. \\n but given the unreliability of intelligence television ought to learn a lesson here about not going on high alert and scaring people /. \\n when we come back one network up the river without an explanation /. \\n reporters are tired of the usual standups you know E3713 kurtz oshkosh wisconsin /. \\n they want to be riding on a train or walking in the rain or something to get attention /. \\n so when nbc \\'s E1614 kosinski was covering some flooding in new jersey for the today show friday [she] set out in a canoe /. \\n and everything was going smoothly until /- \\n well take a look /. \\n good morning /. \\n well obviously we \\'re getting a nice break from the rain but not the flooding /. \\n this is essentially now a part of the passaic river in this neighborhood /. \\n two guys walk into the shot /. \\n and we see that the water is only maybe four inches deep /. \\n talk about shallow reporting /. \\n and as the media research center pointed out this was right before the today show accused president bush of staging [his] conversation with soldiers in iraq /. \\n well that \\'s it for this edition of reliable sources /. \\n join us again next sunday at our new time ten o\\'clock eastern seven pacific for a full hour of critiquing the media /. \\n late edition with E3629 blitzer begins right now /. \\n this is late edition the last word in sunday talk /. \\n all the indications we are getting even /. \\n dealing with serial crimes per se /. \\n we can see the emerging behavior /. \\n we can see that this is a behavior that is not going to stop /. \\n you can have hundreds of individuals as suspects and can narrow the focus of your investigation to a smaller pool of people /. \\n and it gives you a starting point /. \\n the good news is even though at any given point in time that there are these people out there perpetrating these crimes we are getting better at catching them and better at catching them sooner so that instead of waiting until they \\'ve committed twelve crimes or instead of having twelve murders take place before we catch somebody now we may catch them after the first or second murder /. \\n i will never in my lifetime learn why a serial killer becomes a serial killer /. \\n but maybe the work that i \\'m doing now will be able to take other people down avenues to explore with more tools with more ability to experiment with more ability to study on a hands - on basis /. \\n but i will never learn that /. \\n as a psychologist through all the interviews that i \\'ve conducted all the cases that i \\'ve reviewed what i \\'ve learned is that these people while bright um and while at some level charming are emotionally and spiritually bankrupt /. \\n and i \\'ve learned that there is such a thing as evil /. \\n while criminal profiling has been the topic of best selling books and award winning films it is merely one tool used to solve crimes /. \\n the fact is that often offenders are caught while committing minor crimes like traffic violations or simply because they raise suspicion of local police /. \\n that \\'s our crime files investigation /. \\n i \\'m E719 seganthaler /. \\n from nbc news in E4477 this is meet the press with E2303 russet /. \\n our issues this sunday north korea \\'s E6774 jong - il defies the world testing long range missiles which one day could deliver nuclear warheads /. \\n can this man be stopped /? \\n with us from the bush administration the third ranking official at the state department ambassador E7273 burns the former assistant secretary of defense E5005 E6107 of E5835 university \\'s E5780 school of government the man who led the negotiations for the nineteen ninety four nuclear agreement with north korea E3470 gallucci E5373 of the school of foreign service at georgetown university and the former us ambassador to the united nations who has visited north korea five times governor E5515 richardson of new mexico /. \\n and in our meet the press minute former president E3129 E6138 turns ninety three this week /. \\n [he] last appeared as president on meet the press thirty one years ago when [he] talked about age as a state of mind /. \\n but first north korea /. \\n on the fourth of july north korea tested medium and long range +missiles /. \\n and their nuclear program appears to be full speed ahead /. \\n what is the bush administration going to do about it /? \\n here with us the undersecretary of state E7273 burns /. \\n mr. ambassador good morning /. \\n thank you E2303 /. \\n good morning /. \\n E7366 the united states insist that the united nations impose sanctions against north korea /? \\n well we are pursuing a very aggressive resolution up in new york at the security council /. \\n and we think we \\'ve got the votes to pass that /. \\n but we \\'re also operating on multiple diplomatic fronts /. \\n we have our lead negotiator E4168 E5331 ambassador E5331 in beijing seoul and tokyo this week /. \\n president bush and secretary E423 have been working the phones with uh their counterparts /. \\n and we \\'ve also had a very interesting development today /. \\n the chinese government is sending tonight to a senior delegation /. \\n and you know frankly we think it \\'s time for china to use its influence with north korea /. \\n the chinese have influence certainly more than the united states and the other members of the international community dealing with this problem /. \\n china now has an opportunity to put its best foot forward  to send the north koreans a direct message that these missile tests can not be tolerated and the north koreans now have to come back to the september nineteenth two thousand five agreement and they \\'ve got to denuclearize give up their nuclear ambitions and abide by the agreement that they made with the rest of us nearly a year ago /. \\n but the south koreans and the chinese have both said they do not believe there should be sanctions against north korea /. \\n E7366 the us absolutely insist that there be sanctions in the un resolution /? \\n if you look at this un resolution that \\'s under debate in new york it does /. \\n it \\'s a chapter seven resolution so it has the effect of compulsory behavior by all the member states /. \\n it says that what the north koreans did was a threat to international peace and security /. \\n it does ask all member states not to engage in nuclear trade with north korea /. \\n that strikes us as an obvious point /. \\n and i think what we have to do we \\'ll see a lot of diplomacy over the next couple of days /. \\n we \\'ll have to see how the chinese and russians react to this /. \\n but our view is that the five parties ought to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be to use the combined leverage of china and russia \\'s of south korea japan and the united states to force the north koreans back to the negotiating table /. \\n that \\'s certainly the best policy for the united states /. \\n force the north koreans back to the negotiating table /. \\n there are many as you know mister ambassador who believe the north koreans did this launch on the fourth of july to get our attention because they saw the way we were treating iran differently than we were treating north korea /. \\n here \\'s one E7273 burns on national public radio /. \\n with iran the united states has made an offer /. \\n and that is we are willing to sit down and negotiate with the iranians assuming and contingent upon their suspension of their nuclear activities at their plant in the in iran /. \\n why not sit down in the same way with north koreans E5439 to them stop developing your program /. \\n and we \\'ll sit down with you one on one /. \\n well E2303 we \\'re trying to sit down with the north koreans in the context of the six party talks /. \\n we \\'ve been saying for months now that the right step forward is for north korea to return to these talks /. \\n but we really do n\\'t see the logic in turning this into a test of wills between two countries the united states and north korea /. \\n the fact is that china has the same interest as the united states /. \\n it should have the same interest /. \\n and that is to stop the north korea nuclear program /. \\n our allies japan and south korea have the same interests /. \\n and the russians do as well /. \\n and so we think we \\'re far better off working within the framework of the six party talks because you get in that process the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on north korea of all these different countries /. \\n i simply do n\\'t see why it \\'s in the interest of the united states to get those countries out of the way and only deal with north korea directly /. \\n so the problem here is not the lack of discussion between the united states and north korea /. \\n we \\'re perfectly willing to sit down with them in that six party environment /. \\n and in that sense it \\'s analogous to what we \\'re trying to do with iran /. \\n secretary E423 announced about a month ago that should the iranians meet the condition of suspension of their own nuclear activities we \\'d be willing to sit down in another multilateral forum /. \\n and that \\'s with the europeans and russians and chinese /. \\n so really you know the north korea problem is not a problem just for the united states /. \\n what they did the other day on july fourth was to disrupt the peace and harmony of their relations with the asian countries /. \\n and the asian countries want to be involved in these negotiations /. \\n is it the policy of the bush administration that we \\'d like to see regime change in north korea /? \\n well this is one of the most despotic regimes in the world /. \\n it \\'s a major human rights violator /. \\n there \\'s massive famine /. \\n and certainly we hope for the day will come when those people will live in peace and be governed by a different type of government /. \\n uh what we \\'ve got to do now of course is focus on the most immediate problem /. \\n and that problem is nuclear weapons /. \\n the problem is the ballistic launches of the other day /. \\n i think the thing to remember about those launches by the way they were provocative  they were reckless  they were also unsuccessful /. \\n they fired four scud missiles intermediate range missiles /. \\n they tried to fire the longer range missile the /. \\n and that was spectacularly unsuccessful /. \\n it crashed in the sea of japan /. \\n so we obviously have an opportunity now for diplomacy . and an opportunity to use the combined strength of all these countries to provide some leverage put some leverage against the north koreans /. \\n and that \\'s what we will continue to try to do in the coming days and coming weeks /. \\n E7366 the united states give north korea security assurances that we will not attack their country or seek to undermine their regime /? \\n if you look back at this historic agreement that was signed in the six party frameworks on september nineteenth of two thousand five those types of assurances are in that agreement /. \\n but the north koreans have obligations /. \\n and that is to take down their nuclear program dismantle it dismantle their weapons of mass destruction programs in a verifiable way before all those assurances can go into place /. \\n all the other elements of the agreement can be put into place /. \\n and what we \\'ve seen since then is we \\'ve seen the united states and russia and china and japan and south korea willing to go forward willing to sit down willing to implement this entire agreement that you just referred to E2303 /. \\n but we see the north koreans walking away from it /. \\n so we \\'ve got to be very persistent and frankly very tough in combining with these other countries to pressure the north koreans to live up to their commitments /. \\n but we would be willing to give north korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated /? \\n the north koreans know what \\'s in the september nineteenth agreement /. \\n and it \\'s very specific about what the united states is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they dismantle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction /. \\n but they \\'ve got responsibilities in this agreement /. \\n and no agreement is whole until both sides meet their agreement /. \\n and what we \\'ve seen E2303 especially on july fourth is the north koreans in outright violation of the agreement that we made with them last september /. \\n why do you think the north koreans chose july fourth /? \\n oh i do n\\'t think it was coincidental /. \\n you know it \\'s a very unreliable and unpredictable regime /. \\n the last thing we want to do is react to every wild statement that they make /. \\n but they certainly chose that to get our attention and that of the international community /. \\n uh but what they \\'ve got to realize is there is no magic bullet here /. \\n they ca n\\'t just think that they can sit down with the united states alone /. \\n that does n\\'t work for japan /. \\n it does n\\'t work with south korea /. \\n and frankly it does n\\'t work with the chinese /. \\n so i said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this chinese delegation going to /. \\n and E4168 E5331 our ambassador was in china a few days ago /. \\n [he] made the point and secretary E423 made the point yesterday to the chinese foreign minister  we want to see china use its influence /. \\n we want to see china push forward and ask the north koreans to meet these commitments that they \\'ve made to all of us /. \\n speaker newt gingrich the former speaker republican weighed in on this debate in this way /. \\n [he] offered this /. \\n the time to replace the state department \\'s failed north korea strategy of talk forever  act never has come /. \\n for thirteen years the united states has talked loudly about a north korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat /. \\n for thirteen years the north korean dictatorship has lied and hunkered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles /. \\n the strategy of talking has failed /. \\n america \\'s actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal totalitarian dictatorship about which we know little /. \\n it is acting in defiance of all its own international commitments /. \\n but the time for talk is over /. \\n either they dismantle the missile /. \\n or we the united states should dismantle it /. \\n well uh with all due respect to speaker gingrich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success /. \\n and you never want to disavow a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion /. \\n and as i said before we are not alone in this endeavor /. \\n we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure /. \\n i will say this what the north koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system /. \\n you \\'ve seen very strong statements by the japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm /. \\n so obviously we \\'re going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the north koreans on their obligations to pressure them to come back to the talks but also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in E3336 /. \\n and i think you \\'ll see us move ahead smartly in that direction as well /. \\n uh mister ambassador many critics will say the six years E861 bush has been president north korea \\'s program has developed rather dramatically that the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just has n\\'t worked /. \\n here \\'s the latest study from the institute for science and international security /. \\n they estimated a report that north korea has enough separated plutonium to develop now an arsenal of four to thirteen nuclear weapons compared with estimates of just one or two weapons in two thousand when E861 bush became president /. \\n the group says that by two thousand eight north korea could have enough plutonium for eight to seventeen nuclear weapons /. \\n the group \\'s assessment based on analysis of satellite imagery media reports and statements by north korean officials which lead E5941 everstat a conservative critic from the american enterprise institute these are not democrats /- \\n [he] offered this /. \\n although the bush administration \\'s rhetoric about E6774 jong - il and [his] regime has sometimes seemed ferocious north korea \\'s leaders seem to have concluded that the bush north korea policy consists mainly of empty words and that oft repeated warning need not be taken terribly seriously /. \\n by more than one criteria indeed strategic successes on the bush watch outshine those from its during the E6074 years /. \\n would you acknowledge a significant increase in the nuclear capability by north korea on the watch of president bush /? \\n E2303 um obviously we profoundly disagree with um some of the statements that we \\'ve just heard /. \\n eh you know we \\'ve got a very strong military force and deterrent force at work in E3336 and particularly on the korean peninsula /. \\n and that military can handle any contingency that should arise /. \\n we also have a very tough policy and i think forward looking policy to develop missile defense to handle those contingencies /. \\n but you \\'ve got to combine military measures with diplomacy to be effective in a situation like this /. \\n the fact is that a lot of this criticism seems to direct the united states back to a test of wills bilaterally between north korea and the united states /. \\n what we want to do is we want to ask countries that do have a great deal of influence on north korea certainly more than we have to use that influence /. \\n we can do that by channeling those efforts through the six party framework /. \\n and you know diplomacy sometimes ca n\\'t succeed in a day or two or a week or two /. \\n sometimes it takes many months or even years to succeed /. \\n but if you have the right policy in place  if you know what you \\'re trying to accomplish and if you \\'re very tough - minded about applying that policy we can be successful /. \\n so we have not given up hope that we can engineer a policy that will effectively put the north koreans back in the box take away their nuclear programs and take away their ability to inflict threats and damage on their neighbors /. \\n we have got to be single - minded about this /. \\n we certainly understand the gravity of a challenge posed by north korea /. \\n but frankly i do n\\'t think these critics have offered any alternative that would have a reasonable prospect of success or lead us to unintended consequences uh if you went down the road that some of them are suggesting /. \\n and we think we \\'ve got the right policy in place /. \\n and i can assure you we \\'re going to drive with a great deal of energy and determination /. \\n but you do not deny that north korea \\'s nuclear capability has increased during the presidency of E861 bush /? \\n well north korea says that it has a nuclear weapons capability /. \\n and we believe that it has produced that over the last several years /. \\n and that \\'s why we \\'ve put in place this policy designed to take it away from them /. \\n and if we can have the september nineteenth two thousand five agreement implemented it will do just that /. \\n it will effectively de-nuclearize north korea /. \\n and so that is a good bet for the united states /. \\n it \\'s obviously the goal that i think all these critics that you cite would share /. \\n but we think we \\'ve got a much more realistic in the real world strategy put in place to deal with that problem /. \\n but there has been a profound change in the rhetoric certainly of the president on this subject /. \\n here \\'s the president friday at this news conference in chicago about north korea /. \\n it takes a while for a problem to fester and grow /. \\n and then it takes a while to solve them diplomatically /. \\n it just \\'s the nature of diplomacy /. \\n wish we could solve them overnight /. \\n and let me go back to january of two thousand two in the president \\'s axis of evil speech before congress /. \\n let \\'s watch /. \\n north korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction while starving its citizens /. \\n states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world /. \\n by seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger /. \\n we \\'ll be deliberate /. \\n yet time is not on our side /. \\n i will not wait on events while dangers gather /. \\n i will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer /. \\n the united states of america will not permit the world \\'s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world \\'s most destructive weapons /. \\n since the president uttered those words mister ambassador every estimate is that north korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons /. \\n and yet we \\'ve driven forward with this policy designed to respond to all the things the president talked about back in two thousand two /. \\n but [he] has been very consistent since then in putting forward the proposition that we have to oppose the human rights abuses of the government /. \\n we have to try to draw a net around the fact that north korea is the leading exporter of ballistic missile technology around the world the proliferator of it /. \\n we \\'ve done a lot to develop missile defense /. \\n and we \\'ve created and driven forward this diplomatic coalition designed to bring us to a victory in denying north korea the nuclear weaponry that you talk about /. \\n so we have been very activist /. \\n we have followed this policy for a number of years /. \\n uh the president is right /. \\n and as i said before diplomacy ca n\\'t be measured in a snapshot /. \\n you ca n\\'t just say in a sunday morning in july that somehow because we have n\\'t come to the end of negotiations these negotiations are bound to fail /. \\n you \\'ve got to be very purposeful and directed in what you \\'re trying to do and apply the weight of your country and that of others to the test /. \\n and that \\'s what we \\'re doing /. \\n we have not given up on this quest to come to the end of these negotiations and put the north koreans back into a place where they can no longer be a threat to their neighbors or to the united states /. \\n but again it \\'s the tone and the rhetoric /. \\n let me go back and review some of the things the president has said about E6774 jong - il of north korea /. \\n i loathe E6774 jong - il /. \\n i got a visceral reaction to this guy /. \\n and then in two thousand four there \\'s a tyrant in north korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon /. \\n and then this in two thousand two /. \\n the president called [him] a pygmy and compared [him] to a spoiled child at a dinner table /. \\n does the president still believe that E6774 jong - il is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /. \\n E6774 jong - il is a despot /. \\n and [he] is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over the world /. \\n uh these missile tests the other day were certainly reckless /. \\n they were provocative /. \\n and so uh we have n\\'t changed our opinion of the nature of the regime in north korea /. \\n no one in our government has /. \\n we are very clear - eyed about who they are  what they represent  how much they \\'ve denied their own people the basic human rights that people should have around the world /. \\n and we \\'re focused on this nuclear question as well /. \\n so i think there \\'s been a lot of continuity over american policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we \\'ve talked about north korea over the last several years /. \\n and uh we \\'re determined to press ahead /. \\n when the president talked about the axis of evil [he] said iraq north korea and iran /. \\n the united states invaded one of those countries iraq /. \\n some now make the case that iran and north korea took from that the following lesson that if you develop a nuclear bomb and have a strong military you will not be invaded by the us /. \\n and both of those countries have clearly miscalculated their own situation /. \\n now the north koreans felt i guess that by testing these ballistic missiles they would somehow put themselves in a position of greater weight in the negotiations /. \\n they \\'ve miscalculated because you \\'ve seen very tough statements from the chinese and the russians and the south koreans and the japanese against what they \\'ve done /. \\n and you see momentum building in the un security council toward a very tough chapter seven resolution against them /. \\n the iranians have miscalculated /. \\n they thought that they could divide the united states from both our european allies and from russia and china /. \\n but we \\'ve been able to craft a major and united coalition of all those countries /. \\n and we \\'ve essentially given the iranians a clear choice /. \\n and you \\'ll see a lot of this unfold this week both in europe when secretary E423 meets with [her] counterparts on wednesday at the ga summit in st. petersburgh at the end of the week when the president is there /. \\n the iranians are going to have to choose /. \\n negotiations with us after they suspend their nuclear programs or further action in the security council /. \\n so i do n\\'t think either of these countries is on the offensive /. \\n frankly i think both of these countries are rather cornered and isolated /. \\n there are very few countries defending them /. \\n and they \\'re running out of options /. \\n so we think this policy of patient diplomacy and of crafting multilateral coalitions to tighten the pressure around them is going to work /. \\n and it \\'s the right way to go clearly for the united states /. \\n we want to exhaust diplomatic means before we consider other means /. \\n based on our experience in iraq particularly with our emphasis on the weapons of mass destruction that did not materialize E719 deutch the former head of the cia offered this observation /. \\n the next time military intervention is judged necessary to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction for example north korea there will be skepticism about the quality of our intelligence /. \\n do you agree with that /? \\n i do n\\'t /. \\n not in the case of north korea not in the case of iran /. \\n E2303 i \\'ve been to europe twenty times over the last fourteen months to talk to the europeans and the russians and chinese about iran for instance /. \\n there \\'s not a single person at the higher levels of those government who does n\\'t believe iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons capability /. \\n there is n\\'t a single person in the governments of china or russia or south korea or japan who does n\\'t believe that north korea is bent on building up its nuclear capability /. \\n there is no argument in the real world today about what these two countries iran and north korea are trying to do /. \\n there is no argument remotely similar to what we went through in two thousand and two and three with our european allies over iraq /. \\n in fact we are now tightly knit up with these countries /. \\n and if you look at what the E4077 german and british governments are saying as well as the russian and chinese governments about whether or not these countries are intending to create a nuclear weapons capability they agree with our assessment /. \\n so i do n\\'t agree at all that we \\'re somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over wmd in iraq /. \\n let me conclude with comments by E5515 E6698 the editor of weekly standard /. \\n [he] used to work for vice president E3819 quail /. \\n north korea is firing missiles /. \\n iran is going nuclear /. \\n somalia is controlled by radical islamists /. \\n iraq is n\\'t getting better /. \\n and afghanistan is getting worse /. \\n i give the president a lot of credit for hanging tough on iraq /. \\n but i am worried that it has made them too passive in confronting the other threats /. \\n have a preoccupation with iraq allowed north korea and iran to go forward with their nuclear programs and limited our options /? \\n well i strongly disagree with that criticism from E5515 E6698 /. \\n and i disagree for one reason /. \\n we have a very strong and active government /. \\n from the pentagon from the state department the white house treasury we are focused on all these problems /. \\n we created over the last fifteen months a major international coalition to corner the iranian government and to isolate them /. \\n and that \\'s been a diplomatic success over the last several months /. \\n we \\'ve now got this six party talk framework we hope coming back together /. \\n and certainly the five countries are united /. \\n uh secretary rumsfeld was in afghanistan this morning /. \\n and secretary E423 was there ten days ago /. \\n and we \\'re giving that government president government all the support it can get /. \\n we are a government that can operate /. \\n and we have to operate in every part of the world /. \\n we \\'re a global superpower /. \\n we have tremendous resources at our disposal /. \\n and frankly we \\'ve got a first class military and a first class diplomatic effort /. \\n and we can certainly take on all these issues and be successful simultaneously /. \\n and we will be watching /. \\n ambassador E7273 burns we thank you for sharing your views /. \\n thanks E2303 /. \\n coming next the view of three former E6074 administration officials who spent years dealing with the north korea problem former assistant secretary of defense E5005 E6107 chief state department negotiator now at the georgetown university E3470 gallucci and former us ambassador to the un now governor of new mexico E5515 richardson /. \\n they are all right here next only on meet the press /. \\n and we are back /. \\n welcome all /. \\n governor richardson should the united states negotiate directly one on one with north korea /? \\n yes it should /. \\n uh our policy so far is not working /. \\n uh what you have is north korea has quadrupled its enriched plutonium since two thousand and two /. \\n uh the six party talks are going nowhere /. \\n we should talk directly to the north koreans to discuss what is next /. \\n they need to dismantle their nuclear weapons /. \\n they need to destroy their missile capability /. \\n the only way to do that in my judgment is face to face talks at a level of E5344 E5331 /. \\n [he] is a competent diplomat /. \\n uh the successes we \\'ve had with the north koreans have been through direct engagement when i got some pilots out of north korea when E720 gallucci negotiated the agreed framework /. \\n secretary albright close to having an agreement on reducing or terminating their missiles /. \\n what north korea is seeing right now is iran getting a nuclear reactor /. \\n they see iran getting a nuclear fuel cycle that is assured economic incentives /. \\n on the other hand what they want to see is treated with respect direct talks with the united states /. \\n but also they want to see an effort by the united states to give them the recognition that they feel they deserve /. \\n i do n\\'t believe they do /. \\n they are a desolate isolated regime /. \\n but right now our policy is not working /. \\n it makes sense to talk directly with north korea /. \\n but would n\\'t the world then say oh i see /. \\n you test a missile on the fourth of july /. \\n you get the us attention /. \\n and you bring them to the bargaining table /. \\n our policy right now does not work /. \\n look where we are right now /. \\n uh E3336 is destabilized /. \\n we are trying to outsource our foreign policy to china /. \\n i believe china is not necessarily interested in helping us on north korea /. \\n they do n\\'t want to see a bunch of refugees go into their country /. \\n i believe that china is a competitor /. \\n they control a lot of our debt /. \\n right now we do not have leverage over china /. \\n the best effort in my judgment is face to face talks /. \\n hard negotiating /. \\n get that agreement that was uh signed in september that north korea has not abided to /. \\n a time table for north korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons /. \\n efforts to set up bench marks in exchange for that armistice agreement where we do n\\'t attack north korea /. \\n they get economic assistance /. \\n but our objective should be firm /. \\n to get them to dismantle their nuclear weapons /. \\n the best way to do it is face to face talks /. \\n if the president now changed [his] course wo n\\'t the headlines be bush blinks /? \\n no /. \\n i believe the headlines would be bush deals realistically with north korea /. \\n [he] reverses a policy that is not working /. \\n ambassador gallucci do you agree with that /? \\n just about entirely /. \\n uh i have nothing against the idea of the six party talks something E5941 pounded on /. \\n uh uh the virtue of having all these parties in E3336 engaged that \\'s /- \\n it \\'s true /. \\n it is their problem as well as ours /. \\n but the fact is it has n\\'t worked /. \\n and to make the form more important than a substance to care more about whether we have six parties meeting together than whether we stop the accumulation of plutonium is absurd in my view /. \\n you \\'d have some conditions /. \\n you had said prior to the missile test that if they took that missile off the launch pad you \\'d negotiate face to face /. \\n now that they \\'ve launched it would you have any conditions before you went back to the table one on one /? \\n this is kind of a rule i think that you really try hard not to negotiate with a gun or missile to your head /. \\n and i think a decent interval now and some work at the united nations is the appropriate thing to do /. \\n but i think we \\'re taking a view from thirty thousand feet right now /. \\n what should the administration do /? \\n it needs to find a way to get back to the negotiating table /. \\n and the fact that you may get a headline like the president is reversing course as indeed we have in the case of iran that \\'s not so bad if you find you \\'re on the wrong course /. \\n and we have been /. \\n E5005 E6107 do you agree there should be one on one direct negotiations between north korea and the us /? \\n no i actually think the six party talks is a perfectly appropriate forum including for us to speak directly to the north koreans if others are at the table /. \\n let \\'s go back to the logic of the six party talks in the first place /. \\n the reason to have everybody at the table with the north koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with north korea diplomacy has to have a coercive dimension /. \\n and we do n\\'t trade with north korea /. \\n we do n\\'t recognize north korea diplomatically /. \\n uh there \\'s almost nothing we can do short of military action to apply pressure to north korea /. \\n we \\'re capable of military action /. \\n and it \\'s important that that be an ingredient of course in diplomacy /. \\n but the real levers on E6774 jong - il are the chinese and the south koreans /. \\n it is they who essentially support the regime economically and politically /. \\n but makes sense to have them at the table /. \\n the six party talks i totally agree with my colleagues here have produced nothing so far except a quadrupling of the amount of plutonium as ambassador richardson said um in north korean hands and now missile launches /. \\n so they \\'ve been running wild for three years or so /. \\n um the reason for that /- \\n there \\'s a lot of blame to go around /. \\n you have to start with the north koreans and their own intransigence /. \\n the chinese and the south koreans have not done everything that they should /. \\n uh they \\'ve shown the carrots /. \\n they \\'ve been unwilling to show the sticks that they can also wield /. \\n i think on our side um it matters less who else is at the table than that we have our own wits about us as we sit down with the north koreans /. \\n and our government i believe has been divided over the last few years as the six party talks between two camps /. \\n one camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with north korea /. \\n but there \\'s another camp uh in this country and i think represented in the government that believes that negotiating with the north koreans is a fools game or is even immoral because of the nature of the regime /. \\n i do n\\'t agree with that view because i think it \\'s more immoral to let north korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with north korea /. \\n but we have been of two minds /. \\n and therefore i do n\\'t think we at the table has been as effective as we might have been /. \\n you showed some of that ambivalence in the earlier part of your segment where you see the us government saying one thing at one time and another thing at the other times /. \\n though it \\'s important that we get our story straight /. \\n and that \\'s more important than who else is at the table /. \\n you had advocated several weeks ago a preemptive military strike on the missile that was about to be tested /. \\n many criticize that as belligerent /. \\n and perhaps could even trigger a north korea response against south korea or against japan /. \\n who knows /. \\n in hindsight do you still stand by that preemptive military strike /? \\n well i do /. \\n and i want to put that in some context /. \\n by the way i would say we should have that same position today that is if the north koreans go out to the launch pad and erect that missile and prepare to launch it we can destroy that uh before they can do it /. \\n to do so would be a very limited military action a single bomb a single cruise missile /. \\n the north koreans are n\\'t going to start a war in response uh to that kind of action /. \\n and to those that think that \\'s too much i can only say where are you going to draw a line in the sand with north korea /? \\n at some point we have to draw a line in the sand and defend it /. \\n we say things are intolerable /. \\n we say they \\'re unacceptable /. \\n and then we tolerate and accept /. \\n former secretary of defense E5515 E6619 and i thought long and hard about this /. \\n and we thought that this was a relatively nonprovocative way to draw a line in the sand with north koreans /. \\n now i have to emphasize there \\'s risk in inaction also /. \\n you may say there \\'s risk in this action /. \\n but i have to emphasize there \\'s risk in inaction as well letting north korea go nuclear /. \\n governor richardson well how do you think the north koreans would react if we took out their test missile /? \\n well i respectfully disagree with assistant secretary E6107 there /. \\n but at least [he] \\'s got a new idea which the administration does not put forth /. \\n i think if we are seriously attacked or threatened  that missile which was a test was geared to the united states or to our allies we have allied responsibilities with south korea or japan /. /. \\n uh you do take that step /. \\n but the fact is that you risk uh the uh north koreans shooting missiles at south korea /. \\n and we \\'ve got thirty seven thousand american forces at the dmz /. \\n uh but E2303 i think another reason for the face to face talks is that there \\'re two issues that are separate from the six party talks that are a serious grievance in our relationship /. \\n one is the fact that we have frozen financial assets of the north koreans /. \\n i believe rightly so /. \\n but that is a separate bilateral issue /. \\n the second is our objection to dealing with north koreans \\' request for a light water reactor which i believe has bogged down the six party talks /. \\n which by the way i believe you could have a separate bilateral face to face negotiation with the united states and also continue the efforts with the six party talks because it is the south koreans and the japanese that are providing financial and fuel incentives /. \\n so you ca n\\'t cut them out /. \\n but i think it \\'s essential to have face to *face private bilateral talks between united states and north korea /. \\n but in the end it \\'s a judgment of north korean intentions /. \\n you \\'d been there five times /. \\n you know them /. \\n and yet a few weeks before the missile launch you said i do n\\'t think they \\'re going to test /. \\n and they did /. \\n no E2303 i said i believe that they were going to test /. \\n i did say that /. \\n and what i sense in my negotiations in dealing with north koreans /- \\n you said as days go by i do n\\'t believe they \\'re going to do it /. \\n but early on i said that they did on cbs /. \\n uh my point is that when you deal with north korea you \\'re not dealing with individuals like you and me /. \\n do n\\'t believe in compromise /. \\n they believe in their only way or the highway /. \\n their view is that their cause is right /. \\n and they \\'re going to wait you out /. \\n so they \\'re totally unpredictable /. \\n and i believe the only way to deal with them and we have shown that effectively in past dealings with the E6074 administration is direct engagement to get them to curb their nuclear weapons as E720 gallucci did /. \\n secretary albright almost got a missile agreement /. \\n uh E6888 E6107 got uh an agreement which was later violated regrettably with the father E6774 jong - il /. \\n my point is that face to face discussions with the united states directly i believe is a precursor /. \\n the continuation of the six party talks is the best way to go /. \\n but do they keep their word /? \\n here \\'s E3912 albright toasting E6774 jong - il in north korea october of two thousand /. \\n [she] appeared on this program four years later /. \\n and this was our exchange /. \\n but did n\\'t north korea develop a nuclear bomb on E5515 E6074 \\'s watch /? \\n no what they were doing uh as it turns out  they were cheating /. \\n and the reason that you have arms control agreements is that you do n\\'t make them with your friends  you make them with your enemies /. \\n and it is the process that is required to hold uh countries accountable /. \\n ambassador gallucci you negotiated that ninety four agreement /. \\n the north koreans stopped processing in one plant if you will /. \\n but we later found out that at the same time they were making uranium in another plant /. \\n not actually /. \\n no that \\'s not what we found out /. \\n what happened was we did do a deal /. \\n we did stop a uh plutonium based pro-nuclear weapons program /. \\n we made sure that eight thousand fuel rods containing around thirty kilograms enough for five nuclear weapons worth of plutonium stayed in a storage pond /. \\n and the deal would have had the north koreans end their nuclear weapons program /. \\n we think they started cheating in the late nineties by getting some gas centrifuge equipment from pakistan /. \\n we do n\\'t know a lot about that where it is whether the equipment has been put together /. \\n we think over a period of time they \\'ll do what the pakistanis did  what the iranians appear to be wanting to do and put together this gas centrifuge /. \\n but they never got there yet /. \\n or we do n\\'t think they \\'ve gotten there yet /. \\n but they broke their word /. \\n they absolutely cheated /. \\n there \\'s no question about that /. \\n but really you ought to be clear here what \\'s happened /. \\n there was a nuclear weapons program that was stopped /. \\n plutonium production was stopped /. \\n right /. \\n and afterwards tragically i believe that agreement which locked them up was allowed to collapse /. \\n and we find ourselves now with the north koreans accumulating plutonium a bomb \\'s worth a year /. \\n and freed up that plutonium that was um controlled for that period of time /. \\n and they say they \\'ve used it to make bombs /. \\n we \\'d have to estimate about five more /. \\n and with each passing day i would argue to you more important than that missile that E2058 would take out on the gantry if it turns up again with each passing day we \\'re going to find ourselves more and more closer than we were before to the day where that material could be transferred or sold to E5002 - queda presenting a threat far greater than the threat that is posed to us by nuclear weapons aboard ballistic missiles /. \\n we can deter a country with ballistic missiles /. \\n we know the return address /. \\n we do /. \\n but with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against united airlines or american airlines or a bus or a truck /. \\n and deterrents does n\\'t work terribly well when an enemy values your death more than [his] life /. \\n so no defense no deterrents /. \\n we need to lock up the nuclear program /. \\n you would not care about the ballistic missile program if they did not have the nuclear weapons program /. \\n but you can have all the agreements you want /. \\n if they \\'re going to cheat what good are they /? \\n E3912 albright essentially had it correct in my view /. \\n you make a deal /. \\n nobody did that deal in ninety four thinking we were trusting north koreans /. \\n we had some transparency a measure of it /. \\n and you verify /. \\n we caught them cheating /. \\n you might make another deal /. \\n i think you should /. \\n you ask the question you make another deal are you better off with the deal /. \\n or are you better off without it /? \\n if the answer to the former is yes you do the deal /. \\n you do n\\'t +ask i think the simple question have they fooled us before /. \\n then do n\\'t let them fool us again /. \\n i do n\\'t believe that \\'s the way you proceed in international affairs /. \\n it asks a very tough question about the national security /. \\n should we do this /? \\n is it better for us /? \\n ask for more transparency /. \\n insist on it /. \\n be tough in the negotiations not in the formality of whether it \\'s six parties or it \\'s bilateral /. \\n let me show you all two presidents E5515 E6074 back in nineteen ninety three E861 bush ten years later talking to the north koreans in effect /. \\n and i \\'m asking you to put your mind in place of a north korean watching this /. \\n president E6074 president bush /. \\n north korea can not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb /. \\n we had to be very firm about it /. \\n we will not tolerate nuclear weapons in north korea /. \\n E2058 E6107 both presidents making very firm resolved statements /. \\n if you \\'re in north korean watching that knowing that you now have the potential of building eight nuclear bombs what are you thinking /? \\n well i \\'m concerned that they \\'re thinking that we \\'re giving a new meaning to the word intolerable because they keep doing things that we say are intolerable and then we tolerate them /. \\n that \\'s why i think at some point you have to draw the line with the north koreans /. \\n i do think and here i agree with both of the other gentlemen you have on the show who have shown it \\'s possible to reach an agreement with north korea and to get agreements that serve our interests the much maligned agreed framework as E720 galluci pointed out without that agreed framework north korea by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons /. \\n so we were better off with the agreement than without it /. \\n it is possible to reach agreement with the north koreans but not when they see the kind of footage that you uh showed which is uh uh uh americans drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back from that line and drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back /. \\n i think our diplomacy has to have carrots in it but it has to stand somewhere /. \\n and as i suggested earlier i think the missile tests are a good place to take a stand /. \\n governor richardson draw a line in the stand and step back /. \\n the north koreans watch that /. \\n they observe that /. \\n they know what their own has been /. \\n how do you have any strength in negotiating with people like that /? \\n the north koreans in my dealings with them they care more about form than they do substance /. \\n in your earlier segment you showed president bush calling [him] a tyrant /. \\n but then later [he] called [him] mister E6774 jong - il /. \\n i was in north korea when that happened /. \\n the north koreans were delighted because they felt they \\'d been treated with respect /. \\n they care deeply about protocol /. \\n and this is another reason why i think for a relatively cheap price a face to face negotiation at the level of E4168 E5331 who again is very competent i believe would set the stage for a final agreement at the six party talks which is essential which is basically a good agreement /. \\n in exchange for north korea dismantling its nuclear weapons its missiles they get an armistice agreement where they are not attacked /. \\n they get food fuel energy assistance /. \\n security assurances we will not topple their regime /. \\n that \\'s right /. \\n yeah that \\'s right /. \\n that \\'s in that september agreement that E4168 E5331 negotiated /. \\n my point is if it \\'s just going to be a face to face meeting that serves as a precursor that also deals with this frozen assets issue which has directly hit the north korean regime cause it controls the foreign expenditures of E6774 jong - il and you deal with this light water reactor especially now after we \\'ve promised it to iran and economic incentives to iran i think the timing is right for this new stage of direct negotiation /. \\n ambassador galluci based on your experience do you believe the north koreans would give up their nuclear program give up their nuclear bombs which they believe in their mind is an insurance policy against an american invasion for economic assistance light water reactors /? \\n at the end of the day i do n\\'t know /. \\n um but that leaves me to conclude since i really do n\\'t know that it \\'s a good idea to find out /. \\n it \\'s a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four to do a deal with the north that required them to give up the program /. \\n we did that /. \\n and for a period of years we were in a position to monitor that closely /. \\n and they did give it up /. \\n indeed you can make an argument that while the centrifuge program with the pakistanis is clearly cheating was n\\'t yet a genuine nuclear weapons program had n\\'t produced anything and probably still has n\\'t produced anything /. \\n so you have the possibility if the north koreans are thinking the way they may be thinking that they need one or the other  they need either nuclear weapons to deter the united states from regime change or they need a relationship with us that makes it unnecessary for them to have nuclear weapons /. \\n the only way to find out whether they \\'ll ultimately give up those weapons is to do a deal /. \\n we hear so much talk about E6774 jong - il tyrant spoiled child /. \\n others have said madman /. \\n you \\'ve been in that country five times /. \\n who is [he] /? \\n what is [he] /? \\n well i \\'ve never met [him] /. \\n i met the number two in command /. \\n [he] is the entire nation /. \\n [he] is basically a cult of personality /. \\n [he] runs everything /. \\n [he] knows everything that \\'s happening /. \\n all power flows through [him] /. \\n uh what that causes unfortunately

children . \\n the parents are also forced to work in the city . \\n in fact  they have no alternatives but to make such a decision . \\n there are 120 million farmers who work in the city all year round in china  thus creating nearly 20 million left - behind children . \\n i want to tell them that i miss them a lot . \\n day after day and year after year  they long for love in loneliness and wait for family affection in defect . \\n i think that it is especially important to have emotional exchanges with the children . \\n visit the children more often whenever possible . \\n -lsb- -rsb- \\n in september 2005  a study report titled  concern for left - behind children  had drawn wide public attention . \\n while the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question  the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public . \\n ye jingzhong is the assistant dean of the college of humanities and development at china agricultural university  and team leader of the left - behind children task force . \\n in the last two years  [he] has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western china  including shaanxi  ningxia  hebei  and beijing . \\n why did you pick the central and western parts of china  and not the south  to conduct this study ? \\n first of all  for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um  uh  according to their educational level  they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work . \\n they are not in a position to bring their children to the city . \\n when we conducted this research study  our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents  work in the city . \\n  its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents . \\n therefore  we believe that whether it \\'s in southern or northern part  no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in  the results should be consistent . \\n according to your estimation  how many left - behind children are there in china now ? \\n this group should be the biggest in number . \\n um  the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million . \\n nowadays  um   um  many places  um  cite a figure of 120 million . \\n many people quote a figure of 150 million . \\n let \\'s think about it this way . \\n if we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city   at least half of them are um  married before they work in the city . \\n of course  families of these married people will usually have children . \\n moreover  they will usually have more than one child in rural areas . \\n so you can imagine . \\n i believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million . \\n it  uh   in my opinion  should be around 50 million . \\n of course  we have not conducted exact statistical calculations . \\n i believe the number of this group should be particularly large . \\n according to the study by the task force  at present  the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody  skip - generation custody  relative custody  and same - generation custody . among which  single - parent custody had the highest number  accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed . \\n the next one was skip - generation custody  accounting for 16.9 percent . while those who lived with relatives or were entrusted to the care of someone else made up 4.1 percent and .9 percent of the total number of left - behind children  respectively . \\n according to your study  what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ? \\n different types of custody have different impacts on their life . \\n no doubt   single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types . \\n the impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home . \\n there is no major problem in the children \\'s material life . \\n of course  there are many impacts in other aspects  for instance  peer socialization . \\n the one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody . \\n E4607 - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children . \\n there is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children  and there is a type called self - custody . \\n these three types create the biggest and the most impact . \\n if we want to discuss this in more detail  let \\'s say  the skip - generation custody . \\n first  in skip - generation custody  their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation . \\n this is indisputable . \\n this type of family is not as good as the others . \\n we had an example of a child in shaanxi province . \\n um  there was a family ! \\n this family had an older brother and a younger sister . \\n both parents wanted to go to the city to work . \\n the father went first  and later the mother wanted to go  too . \\n what happened to these two children ? \\n the grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas  grandparents also have to work in the field ! \\n as a result   this mother sent  these brother and sister  to martial arts school to study . \\n after they went to the martial arts school for a while  um  their mother was  um  a little worried  so [she] went to visit them . \\n [she] went to visit them . \\n when [she] saw them   the girl cried to [her] and said   i really do n\\'t want to stay here . \\n i want to go home .  \\n later  the mother was moved and brought  this girl home and had the grandparents look after [her] . \\n um  [she] still  ai  left [him] at the martial arts school . \\n um  um  after the girl returned  the mother continued to work in the city . \\n when [she] came back one time in between work  [she] found that the girl \\'s body was dotted with red marks and red swellings . \\n [she] then discovered ah  um  the grandparents had not washed [her] clothes for a very long time . \\n the situation you mentioned  is it common or is it a rather extreme example  because generally  people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ? \\n the situation that i just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common . \\n why is it so ? \\n you said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children . \\n it is true . \\n it is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children . \\n however  for the elderly  with the difference in age and time   their  ways of taking care and loving the children are different . \\n they are influenced by their own habits . \\n for instance  there was a child who was sick . \\n um  the grandparents asked [him] to take  a small pill that was made in shaanxi . \\n they did not even know what it was made of . \\n it was a local method . \\n um  after all  they are different from  um  young people in this respect . \\n instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible  they are influenced by  some habits in this aspect . \\n  they raised this point themselves . \\n another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family . \\n  [her] father and mother are not home  so the entire family falls onto our shoulders  especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland . \\n so  all i can do is to feed [her] and make sure that [she] is not cold .  \\n they also had to face such a reality  one that they could not resolve . \\n after all  a family that had so many people in the beginning   the parents of the children were a very important um  workforce . \\n now it was down to the two grandparents . \\n no doubt  they could not help . \\n in the study of left - behind children  many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city  and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children  have formed two parallel lines that will never meet . \\n farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime  while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school . \\n originally  they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education . \\n however  adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more . \\n during this period  the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children . \\n this pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious . \\n you have seen many kinds of left - behind children . \\n was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ? \\n  um  there was a child in ningxia whose name was yao zhengang . \\n this child  um  did not do exceptionally well in school . \\n what impressed me the most about [him] was that [he] really missed [his] parents . \\n [he] felt particularly lonely and especially wanted [his] father to come back . \\n [he] said that [he] was sick one time . \\n [his] father worked in guyuan  about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home . \\n after [his] father learned that [he] was very sick  [he] ran back to the village right away . \\n after [he] arrived at the village  [he] did not say anything  but to put [him] on [his] back and carry [him] to the town to see a doctor . \\n [he] just carried [him] like that without saying a word . \\n when the doctor in the town took a look and told [him] that they were unable to cure the sickness  [he] carried the child to the county . \\n when yao zhengang told us what happened  [he] said   my father had never bought me so many tasty foods before . \\n on that day  [he] bought me a lot of tasty food while we were in the county  but [he] did not eat any himself .  \\n i thought about this at that time . \\n after i heard this incident  i particularly understood what was in the mind of yao zhengang \\'s father . \\n [he] might have felt especially guilty toward [his] child . \\n what [he] felt was that  i go out to work and leave my child home .  \\n [he] said that [his] child had also said   when [he] was at home  [he] always encouraged me .  \\n [he] would say   no problem . you work hard and get a better grade next time   when i had low grades . \\n if [he] could receive many  such encouragements  [he] would not have um  um  disliked school sometimes . \\n [he] does not want to go to school now . \\n however  in [his] example  i could imagine what went through [his] father \\'s mind at that time . \\n i think that [he] felt very guilty toward [his] child . \\n therefore  i can feel that um  um  parents who work in the city also have no alternative . \\n they are forced into making such decisions . \\n um  there was also this child . \\n there was a child  a girl in xixiang county  shaanxi province . \\n um  when i asked   what do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ?  [she] did not answer . \\n [she] went home to get a small box . \\n there was a small finger inside the box . \\n this was a very terrifying incident . \\n what was the small finger all about ? \\n what happened was that when [her] um  parents left to work in the city  [her] grandparents looked after [her] . \\n they had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay . \\n when [she] went downstairs to play by herself  an accident happened . \\n [her] grandparents said   we ca n\\'t help . \\n we ca n\\'t keep an eye on [her] all the time .  \\n  before they went to work in the city  they could watch [her] and forbade [her] to go down to the cellar . \\n [he] had told [her] not to do that before . \\n however  i said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control . \\n that was why [she] turned this way . \\n -lsb- -rsb- \\n this is ruangang village  bocang town  yi county  hebei province . \\n among the 303 households in the village  one - third of the families have people who work in the city . \\n more than half of the children in the village are left - behind children . \\n most of the children \\'s parents are in the southern part of the country . \\n many people want to save some travel expenses and earn some more money  so it is very common for them not to return home for a year or two . \\n life is so vast . \\n life is an ocean wherever life exists . \\n it has been six years since 14 - year - old jiang beiwen was sent by [his] parents to live with [his] maternal grandfather in ruangang village . \\n [his] parents rely on selling rice in guangzhou to support their child \\'s education . \\n they live a very hard life . \\n little beiwen has not seen them once in the past six years . \\n oh  i see so many children here who can turn for comfort in their parents \\' arms ! \\n ah  i envy them . \\n so  i also  want to be able to turn to comfort in my parents \\' arms . \\n i was at school the time i missed my mother the most . \\n uh huh . \\n we had a market ! \\n oh  every day  there were parents who bought things for their oh  sons and daughters . \\n i also wish that my parents could buy me things . \\n i envied them very much . \\n that was when i missed my mother the most . \\n this is jiang beiwen \\'s favorite photo . \\n it was taken with [his] father six years ago  before [he] sent [him] to live with [his] maternal grandfather . \\n [he] was only eight years old at that time . \\n the only connection that little beiwen has with [his] parents now is to talk on the phone with them once a week . \\n in [his] opinion  affection among family members is something unreachable . \\n how often can your mother call you ? \\n uh  once a week ! \\n what do you talk about ? \\n i will talk about my studies and life . \\n my schoolwork was not quite good when i first came ! \\n my mother scolded me in the beginning when my schoolwork was poor . \\n [she] said that i was losing honor for not doing well at school ! \\n then i cried and after that  my mother cried  too . \\n since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round  parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children . \\n while for temporary custodians  they are only limited to providing superficial care  such as making sure the children have food and stay warm  but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children . \\n the survey found that 36.7 percent of the children had never been to their parents \\' workplace . \\n 8.2 percent of the parents almost never contacted their children . \\n 21.4 percent of the parents contacted their children less than once a month . \\n since their parents are absent  how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ? \\n our study found that um  um  the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone . \\n however  contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called  approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so . \\n what could they talk about in three minutes ? \\n i think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes . \\n of course  we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations . \\n what did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ? \\n what touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children \\'s conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things  such as how much they had earned . \\n as for the content of the parents \\' conversations with their children  first  it was school . \\n whether they were good and how their schoolwork was . \\n second  it was whether they obeyed their custodians and what they ate and things like that . \\n uh  as for safety matters  in fact  they could not have any emotional exchange . \\n we know that sometimes when we talk on the phone  even a pause is a need for emotional exchange . \\n however  the parents may not have realized this . \\n for instance  the child has stopped talking . \\n [he] stops talking because [he] needs to pause to consider how to say what is in [his] mind . \\n the parents may not have realized this point  so they hang up the phone immediately . \\n of course  for three minutes  why was it only for three minutes ? \\n in many cases  it was because they worried about the charge . \\n  many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone . \\n however  um  they considered that um  one thing  sometimes they did not have a telephone at home . \\n it was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors . \\n second  um  they considered that they needed money to make a phone call . \\n some children told me   i secretly called my parents when my custodians were not home .  \\n the children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange . \\n do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ? \\n um  um  we conducted a survey on this question . \\n we were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home . \\n how could that be possible ? \\n how could that be possible ? \\n we interviewed some left - behind children  their custodians  and the people who work in the city . \\n why would n\\'t the children know what they did ? \\n first  we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city . \\n however  a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work  including coalmines  construction  and some others  many of them are dangerous jobs . \\n thus  i believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job . \\n why do they do that ? \\n it is because they are afraid that their children will worry . \\n second   parents  especially fathers  who work in the city have a particularly lofty image in the children \\'s mind . \\n maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of their job or tell them what they do . \\n they  do not want to destroy the lofty image of themselves in the child \\'s mind . \\n at noon  the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home . \\n jiang beiwen has to make lunch for himself . \\n this happens to [him] very often . \\n [he] could look after himself since [he] was nine . \\n what work are you going to do today  other than cooking ? \\n uh  i will do the dishes after i finish eating . \\n if it is sunday when i am free  i will  also do some farm work . \\n what kind of work ? \\n uh  i will hoe the field  uh  when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops  i will help do some work . \\n do you still remember your mother \\'s cooking ? \\n uh huh  i do . \\n it was especially tasty . \\n now  the most i want to know is  my parents \\' health . \\n why do you want to know about that ? \\n it is because i care about my parents very much . \\n i think about their work because i know that they work in the city because of me  so i care about them a lot . \\n they will be worn out from working in the city  working in the city to make money . \\n i believe it is also because of me  so i care about their health a lot . \\n because of you  why is it because of you ? \\n because if they did n\\'t have me  i think they uh  would be a lot more  relaxed when they worked . \\n then  are these children willing to live with their parents ? or go to the city with them ? \\n in regard to this  first   children all want their parents to come back to live with them . \\n however  51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents  go to the city  to live in the city . \\n however  they all wanted their parents to come back  but half of the children did not want to go to the city . \\n we also asked them why they did not want to go to the city . \\n this was also very surprising to us . \\n they said that the city is another world and they were especially worried . \\n they were afraid that once they go to the city  they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that . \\n second  they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city . \\n their parents have to send money home  among other things . \\n if they go live with them  they will add more burdens to their parents . \\n if we are in the city every day  live in the city every day  we may know that oh  city life is like this . \\n as for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city  they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear . \\n as for parents  are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ? \\n i believe when parents make this decision  their main consideration is not willing or unwilling . \\n all parents  i can say the majority of the parents  definitely want to live with their children . \\n however  with the reality that they have to face  i believe that they can not solve this problem . \\n of course  we know what the reality is . \\n first  their families are rather poor to begin with . \\n only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city . \\n they have to make money to support the family . \\n they will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city . \\n nonetheless  i believe there are also many other reasons . \\n they also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city . \\n they have to find a place to live . \\n all these are problems that they need to resolve . \\n the problems they face are too many . \\n if the children go to the city  the expenses will be very high . \\n since circumstances do not permit  they can not bring their children with them  according to their will or their psychological need . \\n many parents are unable to bring their children with them . \\n what would you tell your parents if you could see them now ? \\n i want to tell them that i miss them very much . \\n judging from the surface  is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non-left - behind children ? \\n it is hard to tell from the surface . \\n why is it so ? \\n for these children  it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city . \\n for example  some have just gone for a year  while others have gone for 10 years already . \\n in this case  um  generally speaking  uh  we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect . \\n however  many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn . \\n they had very strange um  um  temperaments . \\n they did not like to speak . \\n there was  a child who was in the first year of junior high school . \\n um  um  [he] told us himself that [he] particularly  um  um  misses [his] father . \\n [he] was very good at school . \\n however  one time we visited [him]  [his] um  family told us that [he] was second in [his] class in [his] examination . \\n after that  [he] became extremely  extremely  annoyed . \\n um  um  um  [his] language and other things became very strange . \\n um  um  we also asked [his] um  um  grandparents who had custody of [him] . \\n they said that when [his] father was home  [he] would always encourage [him] and um  exchange with [him] . \\n um  of course  it was not necessarily because [his] parents worked in the city . \\n however  for some left - behind children  their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development . \\n this situation indeed exists . \\n after all  these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete . \\n i believe love is especially important . \\n children need love from the time they are small . \\n we have to understand our chinese saying   the child is father to the man .  \\n what it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect their entire life . \\n only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future . \\n this is the case . \\n therefore  for this type  um  um  um  this group of left - behind children  psychologically  they do not have family love . \\n um   if the parents work in the city  these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home . \\n perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love . \\n under this situation  i believe  i am not sure  um  i am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up . \\n E7366 they believe there is love in society or not ? \\n E7366 they think that love is important in society or not  because they have never experienced it . \\n they have never completely experienced it . \\n thus  if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be  um  given or received in society  i think this is  something that i do not want to imagine . \\n despite the guarantee in food  clothing  and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money  they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require . \\n according to the survey  more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life . \\n 58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy . \\n are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ? \\n do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ? \\n they thought that this was a reality that they could not um  um  face . \\n they were condemned to this reality . \\n no doubt  i think some  um  parents have not had such profound consideration . \\n why do n\\'t they ? \\n i believe people are all the same . \\n if they face such an urgent need for a livelihood  their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood . \\n they can not consider the deeper issue of children \\'s safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved  satisfied  and guaranteed . \\n for example  there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in shaanxi province . \\n many people whom we interviewed lived in cave dwellings . \\n once there was a flood . \\n  these sisters stayed in the cave dwelling to look after the home ! \\n this happened in the rural area . \\n these two children were looking after the home . \\n their uncle saved them when the flood was almost past their bellies . \\n their father called later to see if they were fine . \\n the family told [him] that they were fine . \\n [he] did not come back after that . \\n [he] did not come back to check if everything was fine . \\n i believe the reason [he] did not return was that [he] would ponder whether [he] should return or not . \\n tomorrow \\'s summit meeting will bring E5182 barak and yasser arafat to the resort city of sharm el - eikh . \\n getting both to attend was not an easy task . \\n the last thing president E6074 did today before heading to the mideast is go to church -- appropriate  perhaps  given the enormity of the task [he] and [his] national security team face in the days ahead . \\n we do have to try to reduce the violee and take a turn back for a period of calmness so that we can move back to a peace process  but even if the violence subsides  israelis and palestinians will still have to deal with an open wound -- a scar so long and so deep from these last two weeks  it may be years before there is a real effort at talking peace again . \\n both sides have almost stepped back six years in terms of their statements and attitudes  six years or more -- before the oslo accords  when the israelis promised land and the palestinians promised security . \\n today there is only finger pointing . \\n arafat deliberately launched it in order to attract the attention of the world by paying with the blood of [his] own people . \\n i urge mr. barak to lift the siege of palestinians  to speak to the palestinians as its neighbors because they are [his] neighbors . \\n the palestinians clearly face the greatest pressure in this summit  since the israelis are not the only ones blaming them for the outbreak of violence . \\n i think we all know that arafat is in charge of the palestinian authority . \\n [he] has the responsibility for controlling the violence . \\n but it may not be so easy for arafat . \\n today  thousands of palestinians are calling for continued fighting . \\n half of the palestinian population is under the age of 14 and many have been influenced by military factions like hamas and hezbollah -- not by arafat . \\n when you talk about arafat and the people around [him]  you have to understand how young this population really is -- how volatile  how close to exploding it really is . \\n almost no one seems optimistic about the future of the mideast . \\n that \\'s the heartbreak of this region says one state department official . \\n whenever you take a step forward  you are bound to be pushed way back . \\n E3836 raddatz  abc news  the state department . \\n back to the middle east tonight . \\n the truce brokered by president E6074 between israelis and palestinians allegedly is in tatters . \\n palestinians now talking about a battle for independence . \\n E7074 says it may abandon the peace negotiations altogether . \\n nine palestinians were killed today . \\n more than 70 people have been wounded  mostly palestinians  but also several israeli soldiers . \\n abc \\'s E720 woodruff is in the palestinian territories tonight . \\n violence ripped through almost every major palestinian town today . \\n the worst was in nablus . \\n four palestinians were shot and killed . \\n in ramallah  thousands of palestinians rushed the israeli checkpoint  then faced down israeli guns . \\n from hebron to gaza  the wounded were carried off so fast it was difficult to count them . \\n as is so often the case  much of the trouble started with funerals that escalated into fury . \\n most significant  demonstrators who had been throwing stones this week  today turned to gasoline bombs . \\n israelis who had been firing rubber bullets stepped up their use of real ones . \\n this was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect  when both sides would call off the violence  but that clearly has not happened  and here in the streets  peace seems very unlikely . \\n tonight on israeli television  prime minister barak said we can not go on as if nothing happened  and if the demonstrations do n\\'t stop  barak \\'s spokesman said E7074 will continue to use live ammunition . \\n they leave no other way for us but to respond with fire  we \\'ll have to do this . \\n palestinian leaders said their people no longer want a cease - fire  they want their own country . \\n we are under occupation and subjugation . \\n the question should be what the hosni mubarak are they still doing there eight years after the peace process began . \\n it is one of the major questions that was supposed to be addressed after the stoning and shooting had stopped . \\n it certainly has not stopped . \\n not yet . \\n E720 woodruff  abc news  ramallah . \\n we are going to take `` a closer look \\'\\' at the great wind cave in south dakota . \\n no easy matter . \\n we know caving is a popular pasttime for some americans  a horrifying thought for others  especially anyone prone to claustrophobia . \\n we asked E5807 muller if [she] would like to do the story of a fascinating man . \\n [she] took a deep breath and said  okay . \\n this wild landscape in south dakota may evoke images of the frontier E4817  but the real frontier is far beneath . \\n elevation plus 11 . \\n the real pioneers are men like E719 sheltons who explore underground caves . \\n the most fascinating is the maze known as wind cave . \\n when you find one where no one has been there  you are the first person  the adrenaline is phenomenal . \\n [he] first came here as a tourist 30 years ago . \\n [he] offered to map it for the E1917 service . \\n i thought would take a week or two . \\n it \\'s now 30 years down the road . \\n i \\'m no closer to completing the agreement . \\n the cave is seemingly endless . \\n 3 miles of the cave have been surveyed  every inch logged by hand  then fed into a computer which plots every nook and cranny . \\n we \\'re only representing about 5 % of the known volume that could possibly be here . \\n 95 % of the cave is unmapped ? \\n yes . \\n the first recorded discovery of the cave was in 1881 . \\n a cowboy hunting in the area heard the sound of rushing wind . \\n [he] followed it to this narrow opening . \\n the wind was so strong  or so the story goes  that it blew [his] hat off [his] head . \\n since then  many visitors have been drawn into this world of crystals  fossils and calcite formations known as forecast work and popcorn and rarest of all  fox work . \\n each new discovery means heading down another tight  dark hall . \\n your stomach is against the floor and your back is against the wall . \\n as we crawled along  we found an item left by earlier explorers . \\n a 103 -

owhali was arrested by kenyan authorities and interrogated by the fbi . \\n [he] told the fbi [he] participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader osama bin laden . \\n abc news has learned [he] also provided details of a plan to attack an american warship in yemen . \\n E5002 - owhali said it would be a rocket attack  conducted by a bin laden terrorist cell  and it would come in the next few months . \\n the next morning  E4684 1998  the fbi sent out a classified message  under director E3873 freeh \\'s name  warning of a plot to attack a u.s. navy ship in yemen . \\n the fbi message went to three pentagon agencies  and as a result  the visit of one american warship to yemen was canceled . \\n the warning came as general E448 zinni was finalizing an agreement for refueling ships in the yemeni port of aden . \\n it apparently left no lasting impression . \\n zinni testifying after the attack on the `` uss E5323 \\'\\' -- aden never had a specific terrorist threat . \\n all the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats . \\n so what happened to the fbi warning ? \\n cia officials say they never received it . \\n fbi officials say they did copy the cia . \\n pentagon officials say they got the warning  but had no idea the source was such a well -

it out . \\n bonnaroo is kind of this going example of what the whole jam band community is turned in . \\n that \\'s what i really like about the jam community  its acceptance of improvizational music  despite whatever region or genre . \\n it \\'s about the freedom of the music and the freedom of expression . \\n well  we sold all 80 tickets through our web site . \\n we sold out in 16 days . \\n i mean  the amazing thing is  we used no traditional advertising . \\n we put all these bands together . \\n it draws a huge audience  so the record companies and the music business has to take all of these forms of music more seriously . \\n it \\'s like strength in numbers . \\n i hope this kind of thing can happen in america  instead of it just being these isolated festivals like bonnaroo  it really can happen in 100 cities every summer  like the festivals do in europe . \\n my only complaint is the overlapping . \\n you know  as a music lover that i am  there \\'s five acts all playing at the same time on five different stages that i want to see . \\n it really comes from the actual bands and the fact that there \\'s this grassroots following that \\'s been there  you know  for a long time  primarily started by the grateful dead  at least the future by the grateful dead . \\n we will get by we will survive . \\n we \\'re carrying on a tradition that started a long time . \\n in american music  improvization is what it \\'s always been about . \\n it \\'s not just clapping and having a good time . \\n it makes you feel a certain kind of love  and hopefully  that translates in the community . \\n you go out . \\n you hug someone . \\n you do something good . \\n you make a better world . \\n for me  that \\'s music . \\n we love you . \\n we -- \\n another

away . \\n as we understand it  the man had the child . \\n it was inside of the city bus . \\n police surrounded this bus near the airport with guns drawn . \\n the man came out and did the spread - eagle like that . \\n just as [he] did that  that \\'s when you saw the child just walking just a few feet away from [him] but the officers were able to get the child away . \\n they handcuffed the man and they took [him] into custody . \\n that was after [he] had actually barricaded himself inside that bus with the child . \\n so that one coming to a peaceful ending  what could have been a very gruesome situation involving that two - year - old child in southern california . \\n that one is over in long beach . \\n some u.s. troops have not had a chance to call home since they were deployed for duty in `` operation iraqi freedom . \\'\\' \\n for some wives  the kindness of strangers has eased their worries . \\n E3020 basin explains . \\n reporter : \\n E1984 \\'s husband E6876 was deployed a couple of weeks ago . \\n [she] and [her] daughter E4576 often shuffle through these pictures of [him] taken before [he] left . \\n [she] has no idea where [her] husband is now  but thanks to a little help from a delta flight attendant  [she] knew [he] got where [he] was going . \\n [she] had taken a picture of [him] and everything . \\n reporter : \\n along with the picture  the flight attendant wrote a letter saying [she] was praying for E6876 \\'s safe return . \\n the trip to E5705 was just the first leg . \\n [he] got on a flight to an undisclosed location  when E1984 got a second phone call from a flight attendant . \\n [he] asked us to call you to let you know [he] \\'s okay . \\n and [she] told us that [he] whipped out pictures of our kids and everything and showed all the family pictures and stuff . \\n reporter : \\n E1984 is not the only military wife who received a photo and letter . \\n [her] friend E507 also got one . \\n turns out E507 \\'s husband flew out on the same flight as E6876 . \\n although a small gesture  E507 says it \\'s meant a great deal . \\n it made me realize that someone out there does care about my husband and the rest of the military  and it \\'s not all anti-war . \\n reporter : \\n even though neither of the women have ever met the flight attendants  they say they \\'ll never forget their act of kindness . \\n we get thousands of e-mail from our viewers every day . \\n here \\'s what some of you are saying as far as our coverage of the top stories is concerned . \\n E3848 writes this -- \\n please continue to write to us . \\n we love hearing from you . \\n just go to our website  cnn.com/wolf . \\n we read all of your e-mail . \\n much more coverage of the new iraq and -- \\n welcome back . \\n we \\'re standing by for the white house press briefing . \\n E2235 fleischer expected to come into the E4817 wing briefing room to brief reporters on a wide variety of subjects . \\n we \\'re all getting  this news in from the speech that the homeland security secretary E6408 ridge is expected to be delivering at the international press club around 1:00 eastern at the top of the hour . \\n we \\'re expecting that the homeland security secretary will announce  that this iraqi lawyer  who provided the information to u.s. military authority ies has been granted asylum here in the united states  together with [his] wife and daughter . \\n they \\'re currently in the E4477  d.c. area . \\n an official tells our justice producer E7084 frieden . \\n so that development important . \\n might get more information from secretary E6408 ridge when [he] delivers that speech over at the press club in the next hour . \\n we \\'ll be monitoring that as well . \\n we also have an update on that disturbing development outside baghdad  about 40 miles or so outside baghdad in fallujah where there was a shootout between u.s. troops and iraqis who had been demonstrating there . \\n E2566 penhaul is joining us live on the phone with more . \\n first of all  E2566  how many iraqis were killed in that incident ? \\n back to the scene in E817 E6706 . \\n we were here moments ago where the man in the green in the forefront of the screen there  the former pow E5249 williams was speaking to the crowd rather emotionally and now you see [he] is taking down the black and white pow flag . \\n i wish i could tell you which site this flag was hoisted in . \\n we have the pictures coming in from central E6706  news 13 . \\n this is that city E7372 in E817  now i \\'m being told . \\n quite an emotional scene this morning . \\n E5249 williams  one of the pows whose face we got to know in the coverage that we saw coming from iraq . \\n other pows from iraq after they were captured and released  that dramatic release that sunday morning when they were picked up by a squadron of marines who had wandered in a town in baghdad and were told where they were being kept . \\n dramatic rescue and then a return home . \\n quite an emotional experience and one of us can only imagine what it must have been like to endure . \\n as we said  quite an emotional moment in E817  E6706 . \\n and you see apache helicopter pilot and [his] wife E1614 who was talking with us on the telephone the sunday morning when the video came in of the rescue of the pows and  [she] identified [her] husband and life just got better and better for [her] after that . \\n moving on now  in upstate new york stock exchange criminal charges have been filed in last month \\'s fraternity hazing death at platsberg state university of new york . \\n 11 members had been charged with negligent homicide for forcing 18 - year - old pledge E705 E5373 jenning to drink an excessive amount of water . \\n the fraternity also faces more than 150 charges for other hazing activities  as well . \\n `` vanity fair \\'s \\'\\' columnist E6792 fair is here . \\n quiting in the E2265 edition  [he] describes the journey . \\n [he] said [he] found evidence that E3964 \\'s day of reckoning well overdue . \\n E5344 hitchens joins us from california . \\n good to have you with us . \\n thanks for having me . \\n your journey  particularly to southern iraq  what is evoked there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history of this regime . \\n give us your insights as to what you think the future holds . \\n do you mean if i start with the past ? \\n not at you will . \\n not at all . \\n not much of a trip . \\n i was n\\'t up the sharp end . \\n i was n\\'t taking risks . \\n i was n\\'t in a position that my dear friend was in when [he] was killed outside bagdad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war  the push for war  the drive for war  all that propaganda  was essentially nonsensical because in 1990  E2809 E3964 made the only self criticism . \\n [he] said  i could either invade kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon . \\n maybe before the weapon and then later [he] said  oh  i should have got the nuclear weapon before i invaded . \\n [he] was right about that  but that means that [he] inaugurated at that point like a dozen - years war where the united states could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we \\'re arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in `91 when it could have been finished . \\n should have taken the side of the rebels then  taken the risk of supporting a shiite insurrection at that point  helping the kurds  removing the regime . \\n absolutely . \\n we \\'d be 11 years into nation building by now if we \\'d done that . \\n that seems to be the core of the argument . \\n as you point out  of course  for the fact of the matter is  the mistakes of E2809 E3964 made possible [his] removal from power ultimately . \\n the mistakes of the united states  again  as you point out  E6330 schwarzkopf making a peace  permitting helicopters to fly . \\n still hurts me to read this . \\n the little town i was in this southern iraq  as far as i got  i ca n\\'t boast of further  is where the talks took place . \\n we have the transcript of the meeting . \\n they say  okay  we have lost this round  do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things ? and [he] says  yeah  that \\'s all right . \\n they ask again  are you sure they mean that ? \\n they ca n\\'t believe the luck . \\n they use the gunships to kill  we think  not less than 50 inhabitants of southern iraq and trying to do that to the kurds  as well  so it was a knife edge . \\n and it \\'s not just being wise after the event  i believe  to say that there was an argument in realtime between the bush administration members . \\n mr. cheney \\'s the only one i know that changed [his] mind . \\n most of those that took the view at that time  think until recently they were correct in saving E2809 E3964 . \\n of course  mr. cheney was in the chain of command with swartzkopf and -- \\n many others . \\n when they made the decision not to move toward bagdad with bad information  namely  the republican guard absolutely devastated . \\n yes . \\n and  well  we know now the harvest of all that . \\n it hurts to think of how many wonderful people in iraq at the academic community  lawyers  human rights activists  civilians  intellectuals  people -- would now be alive  who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights . \\n mistakes made then  mistakes part of human experience  but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes . \\n is it your sense that the united states is on the right track ? that there is a commitment here on the part of the united states to -- \\n well  joining us now  the chairman of the securities and exchange commission  E3848 donaldson . \\n mr. chairman  it \\'s good to have you here . \\n nice to be here  E4701 . \\n let \\'s start with that surprise  the malfeasance that is crossing your desk . \\n are you suggesting corporate america has not learned its lesson yet ? \\n well  no . \\n i think that quote is a little out of context there . \\n there are 15 companies in the united states  and i think the great bulk of them are very honestly managed and so forth . \\n a number of people have had egregious fraud and so forth . \\n there \\'s been a general loosening of morals across the board . \\n what i was referring to in that quote you had was the number of cases we see day in and day out at the lowest levels  scams and so forth  where considerable amounts of money are being made and lost by relatively small investors . \\n is the investor today in your judgment secure ? \\n well  i think that the marketplace is becoming increasingly secure . \\n i think a number of the reforms that have come via the sarbanes - oxley act and a number of things that we have done at the sec are basically making everybody take a new look at how they \\'re performing their duty as a director  how they \\'re performing their duties on audit committees and compensation committees and in wall street . \\n i think the reforms that came as a part of the large settlement are going to change the way research and investment banking are done to the betterment of the individual investor . \\n and some people are surprised and i might even add pleased in this city that your sec has been quick to react when E5071 E2174 of E1704 E2017 made a statement that your sec did n\\'t think and that you did n\\'t think expressed appropriate contrition when E296 stearns stepped out of line in the view of the sec . \\n it was n\\'t a polite phone call quietly made  either from your enforcement division or from your office  it was rather public . \\n is that the way you \\'re going to operate ? \\n well  E4701  we \\'re deadly serious about bringing reform into the marketplace . \\n we \\'re deadly serious about some of the actions we \\'ve taken  and when we see people who do n\\'t appear to be taking it too seriously  we \\'re going to get to them right away . \\n and i think perhaps no one more surprised than some of the people running those firms on wall street . \\n you have also expressed concern about excessive executive compensation  particularly ceo compensation . \\n is there really anything that can be done about this problem ? \\n i think so  E4701 . \\n i think the real next step here is for compensation committees to spend a little more time than they do on what they \\'re really compensating for . \\n i think there \\'s been too much emphasis on performance defined strictly by stock performance and earnings per share . \\n i think there are a number of other measures that indicate how well somebody \\'s doing running a company  and i think corporation boards need to spend more time on that dimension . \\n and with you as chairman of the sec exercising your bully pulpit  one assumes that -- \\n as we said  earlier this week  E1792 E3046 E3636 stepped down and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why [she] stepped down  the job [she] \\'s done when [she] was in office and the job that has yet to be complete . \\n from our new york bureau as i was introducing a moment ago  E3819 fagen  the environment writer for news day . \\n and E3819  E3636 did consider herself sort of the republican environmentalist  but now there \\'s been an awful lot of monday night quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that [she] \\'s stepped down . \\n what do you suppose took place here ? \\n i think many people have watched this administration in action and watched E1216 E3636 in action . \\n the mystery is that [she] took the job in the first place or did n\\'t leave earlier . \\n [she] was quite a misfit for this administration  and [she] showed that over and over . \\n [she] was not good at all at communicating the administration \\'s message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and [she] was even worse at bringing the epa bureaucracy  the epa environmental policy makers \\' message to this administration because [she] saw herself undercut over and over . \\n that \\'s interesting because leading into it  while [she] was new jersey governor  [she] sued the epa and [she] was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist  and then only to end up becoming the head of the epa and then of course  there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations . \\n let \\'s hear what [she] had to say last wednesday here on cnn just after announcing [her] resignation . \\n i \\'m not leaving because of clashes with the administration  in fact  i have n\\'t had any . \\n i report to the president  and [he] has always asked me to give [him] my best unadulterated advice . \\n we have have been on the same page . \\n i was never supportive of protocol because it did n\\'t do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned . \\n i \\'m leaving now because it \\'s the appropriate time to do it . \\n E3819  do you agree with that ? \\n [she] says the appropriate time . \\n do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps [she] was out of step with the administration ? \\n i \\'m sure that it was difficult for [her] personally  but i think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday [she] did n\\'t see herself being undermined and overruled . \\n i mean if E1216 E3636 and the white house were on the same page  i do n\\'t think i \\'ve seen a book large enough to contain a page that big . \\n over and over there were many  many instances over the last -- \\n moving ahead now to a developing story  the hunt for so - called smoking gun  meant to prove that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction . \\n here \\'s national security correspondent E5249 ensor . \\n reporter : \\n while u.s. forces still have n\\'t found any weapons of mass destruction  the new cia pentagon report says officials are now confident the mysterious trucks filled with high - tech equipment found in iraq are indeed mobile biological weapons production facilities  just as secretary of state E3094 predicted and presented the united nations before the war . \\n it \\'s very important to recognize that programs that we had said existed do exist . \\n reporter : \\n though no trace of biological toxin was found in the trucks  u.s. intelligence officials say they have largely eliminated any other possible use for the fermenters and other equipment . \\n not everyone is convinced . \\n they could very well be biological weapons production facilities  but i do n\\'t think the intelligence community has made an open and shut case . \\n reporter : \\n the cia - pentagon reports admits the trucks were not an efficient way to produce biological weapons  but officials argue the point for the iraqis was to produce some and not to be caught doing it . \\n this was clearly a very inefficient way to produce anthrax  and the question is why did they invest such resources in a mobile -- \\n moving on to the laci peterson case E5515  an unusual request from E1905 peterson \\'s attorney . \\n a pair of laci peterson \\'s missing shoes could be very important evidence in E1905 \\'s murder trial . \\n [she] is asking anyone who finds the pair to give them back . \\n no sign of geragos or peterson in court yesterday when a judge was considering whether to unseal warrants obtained before E1905 peterson \\'s arrest . \\n peterson awaiting trial in the murder of [his] wife laci and their unborn son . \\n joining us  E3020 caras . \\n good

high would hit a low . \\n that july  E2217 E975  E1395 \\'s long - time manager  wife and best friend  announced to the world that [she] \\'d been diagnosed with colon cancer . \\n every fiber of E1395 was shaken . \\n [he] had to be sedated for a while . \\n reporter : \\n E2217 would have to undergo rounds of chemotherapy all summer . \\n E1395 took time off from oz-fest to tend to [his] wife . \\n ever the rock  E2217 faced cancer head on . \\n when you go in there and people so much worse than me  and it \\'s like  how lucky am i to have a great support system . \\n reporter : \\n even with E2217 trying to make things as easy as possible on [her] husband  [he] was still a mess . \\n [his] struggle with sobriety would be tested again . \\n E1395 \\'s not doing too good right now . \\n drinking ? \\n drinking and [he] \\'s very delicate . \\n [he] \\'s  like  dealing with it the best [he] can . \\n reporter : \\n despite E2217 \\'s illness  it \\'s business as usual for the family . \\n though pushed back  filming commenced last fall on a second season of `` the osbournes . \\'\\' \\n some days when i \\'m feeling bad  i say i ca n\\'t do this anymore  and then you wake up and see the crew  and then  you know  you snap out of it . \\n reporter : \\n the larger question loomed . \\n how could comedy come out of chemotherapy treatments ? \\n E2217 is dealing with the diagnosis and illness but what \\'s interesting is humor is the same . \\n reporter : \\n and the humor did remain the same . \\n the show came back with a vengeance last fall chronicling E1395 and E2217 dealing with cancer and the kids coping with new - found celebrity and one of the top rated shows . \\n ratings for the second season slid . \\n i \\'m not banking my whole life on bringing  you

remission  but just weeks after that announcement  son E6876 entered drug and alcohol rehabilitation in california . \\n [his] family said that [his] party life style caught up with [him] . \\n now  with a third season set to start  will E1395 \\'s role as a family man change the image in the annuls of heavy metal mad man ? \\n i think E1395 \\'s the guy that hit a head of a bat  you know ? \\n crazy  drug taking  hard drinking  hard living rock n roller . \\n i think what the show does is also show that you might be those things  but also might be a pretty great dad  too . \\n i would n\\'t be here now if it was n\\'t for my wife . \\n i always loved my wife but sometimes i do n\\'t like [her] and sometimes [she] does n\\'t like me but we love each other . \\n i hate these people that go

devastating lows . \\n a manic life  grounded in family values . \\n E1395 \\'s not going to like me saying this  but [he] \\'s a very tender  gentle man . \\n this is a guy whose world revolves not so much around music as around [his] wife . \\n E5455 `n roll ! \\n part of the legacy of E1395 E975 is a cautionary tale . \\n it \\'s also  you know  tale that includes family love  you know  and a lot of good things . \\n we have had it . \\n reporter : \\n it \\'s a tale that continues to unfold . \\n no telling how long the E975 phenomenon may last but the family \\'s loyal following will

are able to have disagreements  but remain firm partners . \\n it is no secret that the significant differences between our two countries earlier this year on how best to handle iraq  but we are now able to look forward together firmly in agreement on the route we have decided in the united nations  although  the tragic loss of british lives today reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced . \\n but as we look ahead  we know that our long - term partnership is of profound importance to both of us . \\n this is clearly evident  if we look beyond the challenges of international politics . \\n in the last few months alone  we have heard the announcements of major investments in russia by british companies . \\n we have also heard a different sign of sir E2138 mccartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in E3996 square  and we  in turn  have been enthralled by the celebrations of your own city in petersburg . \\n at the same time  work continues to bring the young people of our countries closer together through language  teaching  school exchanges and university programs . \\n we have a vibrant and exciting relationship from which we both derive mass benefit . \\n mr. president  your country is rich -- \\n we have a major development to report tonight involving the crash of that singapore airlines 747 in taiwan this week . \\n taiwanese officials thousand now say . \\n they confirm the pilot made a wrong turn  simply down the wrong runway . \\n correspondent E1288 colt has our report . \\n tonight it appears at least 82 are dead from what may have been a wrong turn . \\n sources close to the investigation tell nbc news that singapore airlines flight 6 tried to take off on a runway closed for repairs . \\n [she] crash site today  the trail of evidence on the closed runway . \\n chunks of wreckage  fuselage  stretching in a straight line for hundreds of yards . \\n twisted overturned construction equipment . \\n this is what the 747 slammed into E3030 night in a blinding rain storm . \\n today investigators say the pilot had confirmed with the control tower moments before taking off [he] had turned onto the correct runway but pilots behind [him] say [he] turned onto the wrong runway . \\n they say the plane took off  clicking the construction equipment  slamming into the ground and then breaking up . \\n as the plane was taking off this passenger noticed [she] did n\\'t see any runway lights . \\n i used to see the lights going by and i looked out and said it \\'s pitch black out here . \\n reporter E1715  flying in from california  unsure if [his] wife was alive  today  identifying [his] remains  and tonight survivor E719 diaz begins the long trip home to california . \\n i just want to get home  never been so ready to get back to the united states . \\n [his] flight number a reminder singapore airlines 006  the same flight [he] survived E3030 night . \\n E796 E106  they did get a unanimous court for this decision . \\n absolutely  E5880 . \\n it was very stern  very direct and it left no question  i think  in the minds of anybody that this court unanimously believes that certification should include the manual recount  and that is a clear victory for vice president E5002 gore . \\n the language here  really leaves no doubt . \\n the right of the people to cast their vote  the court said  is paramount . \\n the amended certifications must be accepted by november 26 . \\n the reason they are picking that particular day is it allows  E5880  enough time for the aggrieved party  the losing party to file within 10 days a contest of the certification and that still allows enough time for the contest to be litigated through the courts primarily the circuit court and back to the supreme court if necessary and still meet the december 12 deadline for the electoral college vote here . \\n now  E2282  the only question that means anything at this hour . \\n we know their view is the hand counts should now be included . \\n E7366 it put E5002 gore over the top in the race to match and exceed the votes of E861 w. bush ? \\n it very well could  although  i must say that the gore campaign has been somewhat disappointed by the number of votes they have not received thus far in the counties that are undertaking the manual recounts  E5880  but a lot of hand counts still must be tallied . \\n we are also including the undervotes of 10 in palm beach and junt votes of 10 in miami - dade as well . \\n keep in mind  those were not registered by the computers because they either had a hanging chad or dimpled chad . \\n those must be gone over by hand by each respective canvassing board . \\n so there are a lot of votes remaining there . \\n this is a gore campaign to the white house . \\n E2282  just a logistic question  how long is it going take you to get the opinion run to you from the building behind you ? \\n i would say we should have it here in the next five minutes . \\n it depends how quickly the line moves . \\n we have two producers  i believe  near the front of the line . \\n it how quickly they get handed . \\n it reversed the two orders of the earlier trial court  circuit court judge E7084 E2502 . \\n the bottom line  this court rules unanimously the right of the people to have the votes counted is paramount  thus  the amended certifications to include the hand counts must be accepted by november 26 . \\n in fact  it seemed to have some language here . \\n in fact  E5880 i do have it handed to me now . \\n let me take a the . \\n E5880  if for some reason the secretary of state would n\\'t accept by the 26th  the certification  it could be certified elsewhere . \\n E796 E106 . \\n i should point out  [he] is a former lawyer himself and so can help put this into english . \\n E2282  go ahead  if you come to a passage we should hear . \\n i \\'m flipping through the summary of enacts because that is not important . \\n the summary of facts . \\n you flag us when you come to the first portion we should hear aloud . \\n recapping the developments of this disturbing day in the middle east and the arabian peninsula -- at least six american sailors are dead  11 still missing and 35 injured after what intelligence experts say was a well - planned terrorist bombing that ripped a 20 x 40 - foot hole in the navy destroyer `` uss E5323 \\'\\' in the yemeni port of aden . \\n the ship was there for refueling . \\n president E6074  vowing retaliation . \\n as we heard from E5249 E5385  one of governor bush \\'s main themes in these last days of the campaign is getting rid of partisan gridlock in E4477  which was exactly what the president was talking about today -- an attempt to reopen debate on a $ 240 billion tax cut plan  saying the version house republicans passed is unacceptable  because it is unfair  according to the president  to children and seniors . \\n instead of meeting us on common ground  instead of working with the white house or congressional democrats  the republican leadership closed its doors to compromise -- literally closed the doors to compromise . \\n they crafted their own partisan tax package and passed it last night on a party - line vote . \\n republican leaders for their part said reopening the tax debate is not now realistic and the tax cut bill is probably tombed . \\n they are angry that the president is threatening to veto it saying it \\'s wrong to have political budget battles right before the election . \\n nbc \\'s E5249 E5385 is at [his] post as well in E1498  texas . \\n E5249 any reaction from the bush team on the democrats \\' plan to contest the vote in miami - dade ? \\n well  E719  there has been reaction from the bush team . \\n you know  this decision by the gore campaign  a refusal to concede even if they do not prevail in the manual recounts under way certainly carries some political risk  but the gore team tonight defends the decision  saying that fellow democrats and the public would not only accept but demand what they call a fair and accurate recount in all the relevant counties . \\n the bush team  responding quickly saying there would not be such support and that in that scenario gore could only be seen as a sore loser . \\n despite the holiday  there is no letup in the fight for E6706 . \\n a holiday legal victory to be thankful for  E861 and E3687 bush  all smiles in E1498 today before a pot luck thanksgiving meal with their twin daughters and friends . \\n the texas governor makes time for recreation with a morning jog and prepares for some fishing at [his] ranch this weekend . \\n the vice president out of sight today at [his] residence  aides saying the entire family together for a meal and football on tv . \\n while the gore menu remains a family secret  the bush clan all to happy to share some of [his] favorite fare -- jalapeno pecan cornbread stuffing and coconut cake . \\n for vice presidential candidate E6661 cheney  turkey in the hospital with [his] wife and daughter this afternoon . \\n after suffering a mild heart attack yesterday  [his] fourth  doctors say today [he] \\'s recovering well . \\n cheney gets a checkup call from governor bush and still expects to be released as early as tomorrow  and today  president E6074 cautiously speaks out about the E6706 vote fight  saying everyone should  `` let the process play out . \\'\\' \\n i want everybody who tried to vote who legally voted to have their vote count  including service people . \\n everybody . \\n tonight for both E861 bush and E5002 gore and their war rooms all their advisers  this really comes down to a numbers game . \\n everybody keeping a sharp eye on these recount tallies and on sunday \\'s deadline at 5:00 p.m. . \\n E719 ? \\n nbc \\'s E5249 E5385 in E1498 . \\n E5249  thank you . \\n up next  from recounts to -- \\n and one of the longest running struggles for international justice reached a milestone today of sorts  when a scottish court  meeting in the netherlands  finally officially found someone guilty in the 1988 bombing that brought down pan am flight 103 . \\n [he] \\'s a libyan intelligence agent and as nbc \\'s E1796 maceda reports tonight from the court  many of the families of the victims think the verdict did n\\'t go far enough . \\n today was d - day in the murder trial which in the end brought some relief . \\n for grieving families  only a partial victory . \\n after 12 years of waiting and a nine - month trial  family members of some of the victims of pan am flight 103 come to this special scottish courthouse in the netherlands one last time to hear the verdict against two libyan defendants charged with murder . \\n a split decision for lamen khalifa fhimah  aquittal  but E1171 basset E7339 E5002 - megrahi found guilty as charged . \\n the court ruled this senior libyan intelligence agent planted the bomb that killed 270  mostly americans  when the plane bound for new york exploded over lockerbie  scotland . \\n inside the courtroom today  the elation overwhelming . \\n a good many of the relatives gasped . \\n there was a big intake of breath . \\n E1796 swire  whose daughter died in the 1988 crash  collapses . \\n [he] later recovered  blaming stress . \\n but E5002 - megrahi \\'s sentence  20 years in jail  too light for E5880 E2941 . \\n [his] brother was on flight 103 . \\n it was n\\'t one murder it was 270 people [he] murdered . \\n frustration too that moammar khaddafi was immune from prosecution  one of the ground rules here . \\n you get the operatives . \\n you do n\\'t always get the higherups . \\n reaction in libya  where many followed the trial  mixed . \\n some anger in the streets  but government officials downplaying the conviction  calling for an end to international sanctions . \\n not yet  says president E861 w. bush  at the white house today  demanding that khaddafi meet certain conditions first  to accept responsibility for this act  and to compensate the families . \\n but even that would fall short for those who have lost loved ones . \\n tonight  some of those families made it clear their battle is not over to get to the truth and however difficult  punish the real authors of this crime . \\n E6408 ? \\n thanks very much  nbc \\'s E1796 maceda tonight for the trial of the lockerbie 103 pan am crash . \\n former u.s. representative E238 yates has died . \\n when [he] retired last year  [he] was the oldest and longest serving member of the house . \\n npr \\'s E4193 corley reports from chicago . \\n E238 yates was first elected to the u.s. house in 1948  when E3107 E7018 was president and for more than 4 decades [he] trounced every challenger to face [him] in congressional election . \\n [he] sat out 1 term after losing a u.s senate race in the 1960s  but for 24 terms  yates represented chicago \\'s northern lake front and northern suburbs . \\n the congressman was known as a fervent liberal and supporter of the arts and [he] was noted for [his] success in getting congress to finance for national endowment for the art . \\n in 1993  yates was awarded a presidential citizen \\'s medal for [his] efforts . \\n yates was born in chicago and [he] was one of the few politicians who successfully walked the tight rope between the chicago machine and its independent critics . \\n [he] died yesterday of renal failure and complications from pneumonia . \\n E4193 corley  npr news  chicago . \\n in what may have been a ripple effect of the middle east crisis  an explosion today killed at least four sailors on a us navy destroyer in the yemeni port of aden . \\n american investigators are going to the scene but in E4477 at the white house  the pentagon and the state department  us officials are already expressing suspicions that today \\'s explosion was an act of terrorism . \\n the world \\'s E2917 E5070 reports . \\n the blast  which occurred just after noon local time in yemen  ripped a 20 x 40 foot gash in the uss E5323  a state - of - the - art destroyer that had stopped in aden to refuel before joining the carrier E861 E4477 in the persian gulf . \\n speaking at the E5323 \\'s home base in norfolk  E3957  admiral E719 foley said that the navy is investigating the incident . \\n i do n\\'t know whether it was terrorism or not . \\n it was an act of certainly a severe belligerence but we do n\\'t know the source  nor can i comment any further on that . \\n but in E4477  pentagon officials went further saying that they had every reason to suspect that the blast was caused by terrorists . \\n the officials said that reports from the scene  including one from an army officer working in aden harbor  suggested that a small rubber craft that was helping the E5323 dock came alongside the destroyer and caused the blast . \\n many  including retired admiral E6088 E7579  are suspicious that the small boat may have been loaded with high - power explosives and that the attack was planned . \\n that craft that approached the E5323 is a rubber boat  not a big craft  but they would have had to pack it fully with explosives to do the amount of damage that they did to the E5323 and that certainly would have taken time to get that put together . \\n while both the pentagon and the justice department today dispatched teams of experts to yemen to investigate the explosion  secretary of state E2364 albright urged caution saying it was too early to jump to any conclusions . \\n still  [she] promised that the united states would take appropriate action if terrorists were found to be behind the blast  a sentiment echoed later in the day by president E6074 . \\n if  as it now appears  this was an act of terrorism  it was a despicable and cowardly act . \\n we will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable . \\n if their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the middle east  they will fail utterly . \\n for some terrorism experts today \\'s attack  which occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between palestinians and israelis in the middle east  has an eerily familiar ring to it . \\n E5961 hoffman is the director of the E2291 corporation \\'s E4477 office . \\n we have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in the middle east often embroil the united states . \\n one only has to recall the bombing of the us marine barracks in lebanon in 1983  also a month before presidential election  also at a time when E7074 was involving suitable ferment at that point in lebanon now with the palestinians  where the united states was also attempting actively to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom and that seems to be the salient fact of this attack . \\n and if this attack turns out to be the work of terrorists  hoffman says it would signal a dangerous new trend . \\n maritime or marine - borne terrorist attacks are actually quite rare . \\n that being said it could well be the beginning of a new pattern . \\n we have made it far more difficult  appropriately so  for terrorists to attack our ground forces in the arabian peninsula . \\n so  i think terrorists prevented from attacking their targets using their more conventional means ` truck bombs \\' have merely adjusted their tactics slightly and obviously they have been successful with it today . \\n on yemeni tv today the country \\'s president expressed [his] heart - felt condolences to those who were killed and injured  but denied that the explosion on board the cole was caused by terrorists  although  admits E145 E5002 - qadhi  editor of the yemen observer newspaper in the capital sana  anti-american sentiment has been running high in yemen because of events in the middle east . \\n the people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as arabs  as human beings  that what is happening in palestine is not humanitarian . \\n regarding the united states \\' attitude in this regard  we find that the united states until now are supporting E7074 . \\n the people here feel that united states should do something . \\n with tensions running high throughout the middle east  today \\'s incident off the coast of yemen serves as a warning . \\n us armed forces and diplomatic personnel might be on high alert for sometime to come . \\n for the world this is E2917 E5070 . \\n in the other major story out of the middle east  arab foreign ministers met today in cairo in advance of saturday \\'s arab \\'s summit . \\n egypt called the emergency summit to declare support for the palestinians in the wake of three weeks of violence that has left at least 106 people dead  almost all of them palestinian . \\n violence has abated somewhat since the deal was struck at sharm el - sheikh two days ago  but arab governments are under pressure from their own citizens to take a tough stance against E7074 . \\n E2691 drummond  covering the arab summit in cairo for the financial times . \\n E2691  there \\'s a reason why the arabs wanted this pre-summit meeting . \\n what is the pressure on them prior to the summit ? \\n well  i think they want to try and iron out any potential difficulties before the heads of state come into town on saturday and sunday . \\n so this is a preparatory exercise to reach some sort of agreement beforehand . \\n of course  the problem is that not all arab states are speaking again with one voice . \\n what do they hope to achieve ? and what can you claim from the statements made today ? \\n it is difficult to say  arab \\'s summit have traditionally been exercises in division . \\n we have already seen problems from libyan leader muammar gaddafi on E3030 who appeared on E5002 - jazeera  the pan-arab satellite channel  and  rubbish  what [he] said was a draft statement for the end of the summit on sunday . \\n and [he] was very categorical that it was too weak and did not harm israeli interests sufficiently . \\n so we have gadafi on the one hand . \\n on the other hand we have egypt which was the first arab country to make peace with the jewish state  which is of course also a top recipient of us aid . \\n the egyptian president hosni mubarak is more of a voice of moderation against the other side . \\n tell us about what [he] has been saying . \\n well  mr. mubarak has been  as you say  a voice of moderation . \\n [he] has invested an awful amount in the peace with E7074  and really [he] can not afford to let it fail . \\n we have seen some more power techniques perhaps from [his] foreign minister amre moussa over the last few weeks  but amre moussa today at the foreign minister \\'s meeting was calling simply for the return of east jerusalem to the palestinians  in stark contrast to syrian foreign minister faruq al - E5632 who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between E7074 and the two arab states that happen . \\n so egypt is playing a calming role . \\n it will not want to see anything too strong coming out of this summit due to end on sunday . \\n what seemed to be the prevailing voices at this point ? \\n there are certainly calls for war against E7074 . \\n is there much support for that ? \\n well  actually president mubarak was very categorical today in condemning calls for war  which [he] said were very serious and people should understand the implications of just what it meant . \\n egypt and E4576 do not want to see any sort of conventional war against E7074 . \\n they have both invested enormous amounts in it  and both regimes would be more vulnerable if the peace process were to fail  because detractors and opponents within each country would have ammunition by which to fire at them . \\n how much is the united states entering into the conversation and how much pressure seems to be coming from the united states ? \\n well today not too much . \\n i mean E2364 albright was in saudi arabia yesterday where [she] met with crown prince E1383 and the new syrian president bashar E5002 - assad . \\n interestingly enough [she] is quoted as telling general sanholi back to the us that [she] did not really get too much of a reception from bashar E5002 - assad in terms of lightening the traditionally antagonistic syrian align towards E7074 . \\n nonetheless  the fact that [she] did meet with bashar E5002 - assad and it was n\\'t saudi arabia which is traditionally being more dovish and has supported us policy  it is significant . \\n so  as of today  i would say certainly on the surface there has been little us action . \\n well  thank you very much for the update . \\n E2691 drummond  correspondent for the financial times of london speaking to us from cairo . \\n thank you E2691 . \\n thanks . \\n with this month \\'s ouster of strongman slobodan milosevic  yugoslavia is rapidly joining the international community . \\n today  the country was admitted into an international balkan development program . \\n belgrade now hopes to join the united nations  the international monetary fund and the world bank . \\n at home  president vojislav kostunica says that [he] intends to promote democracy and free speech  but kostunica just might have second thoughts  once a theater group that roasted [his] predecessor over the coals starts turning [him] on a spit . \\n the world \\'s nened chebeck reports from the yugoslav capital . \\n these days at almost every street corner in central belgrade  there is a stall selling compact discs with protest songs against the former regime  and the most popular tune blaring out of the speakers goes like this  `` attention  attention  last train for serbia via day stop kosovo and the hague is departing with a ten hour delay . \\n it \\'s the latest hit by the satirical theater called `` index \\'\\' . \\n they started off 20 years ago in a local radio station and became an enormous success on stage and not just here in serbia . \\n they toured the world and performed wherever there is an emigrant community from the former yugoslavia scattered by the wars here  from australia to new york where index will be returning in late november . \\n this song is from their latest play  the last train for serbia  which was recorded on the day protestors stormed the federal parliament in belgrade and the main television stations . \\n the song speaks of panic in the household of slobodan milosevic . \\n even before the former president conceded defeat  the index theater performed live on an improvised stage outside the parliament  in front of a crowd of some 300 people . \\n actor drugewbo unitich tells how the show began . \\n the first thing that i told them was please let us close our eyes and just listen . \\n when they did that and i saw them and i told them in a voice of milosevic  `` ladies and gentleman  i am definitely finished . \\'\\' \\n only 3 or 4 hours after that [he] appeared on television and said something very similar to that . \\n yubitrich is one of belgrade \\'s most popular actors and [he] owes it to [his] skilful portrayal of slobodan milosevic . \\n getting into milosevic \\'s shoes even on stage  was quite a temptation says yubitrich . \\n i always felt when i enter [his] person  okay  that i can do whatever i want and i always molested our fellow players you know . \\n so being milosevic is something which i can compare to taking a dangerous drug . \\n but with milosevic out of the way  what next for serbia \\'s most popular satirical group ? \\n writer vojislav jonetic says [he] is confident the new yugoslav government will provide plenty of fresh material . \\n we will have plenty of politicians  which we can play . \\n we will have plenty of idiotic situations in serbian politics . \\n political satirical theater is something which you can apply best to the societies  which are in some kind of crisis . \\n we are still in crisis and we will be i think for a while  but the current crisis jonetic hopes will at least be one where government critics will not be branded as traitors and be banned from public performances . \\n index theater is planning a huge comeback now with a series of shows in belgrade  but even though milosevic is under de facto house arrest in belgrade  [he] is very much present on the repertoire of political humors  says [his] impersonator  dragewbo yubitrich . \\n i would like to share one joke with the listeners of the world . \\n it \\'s the year of 2004 . \\n in serbia it is 57th round of elections from september 2000 and slobodan milosevic appears on national tv and says  `` i want to greet you as your new president  my name is vojislav kostunica \\'\\' . \\n yubitrich says  [he] has already set [his] sights on the new yugoslav president  kostunica and will most likely be impersonating [him] in the future . \\n [he] is not as easy to make fun of yet yubitritch says  unlike milosevic  but that does n\\'t mean [he] will escape the scrutiny and sharp wits of index theater . \\n for the world  this is nenad chebeck in belgrade . \\n this is the world  i am E5013 mullins . \\n up next a global hip - hop beat laid down in new york and danced to in the E4817 african nation of senegal . \\n the world \\'s E6927 warman has today \\'s musical finale . \\n imagine trying to translate the lyrics of the sugar E5331 gang \\'s notorious rap classic  rapper \\'s delight . \\n fortunately for rap fans in the senegalese capital  dakar translating these tunes is n\\'t necessary . \\n the city has its own homegrown hip - hop scene . \\n it is a hip - hop but african hip - hop with african instruments  you know  african chant  traditional sounds . \\n that is amidu E7284  one half of the duo positive black soul or pbs . \\n they are the doyens of dakar \\'s hip - hop scene  the sugar E5331 gang of senegal if you will . \\n positive black soul sings in senegal \\'s main language wolof but if the music sounds like it comes straight out of the bronx  well  you are not far off . \\n pbs produce their albums in new york . \\n lead singer amidu E5106 says new york producers make hip - hop in any language come out sounding right . \\n they know how to make a hip - hop record sound good . \\n they know the sound of hip - hop  you know  and they have got the equipment and the engineers and they know how to handle it . \\n but positive black soul \\'s music is first and foremost senegalese music . \\n when american saxophonist E5249 E2711 recorded [his] acclaimed afrocentric jazz album  fo juke review in dakar  [he] recruited amidu E5106 and dj awadi from pbs to show what an edge E4817 african music can really have . \\n when awadi and E7284 performed  they managed simultaneously to bathe in the group of american hip - hop and they keep a clear sense that they are from senegal . \\n this connection to national and musical identities results partly from the fact that many senegalese artists want to stay in senegal to live and work says pbs singer tidia awadi . \\n it is because they know they have the inspiration in their country . \\n i think everybody want to stay in [his] country  want to die in [his] country . \\n if you can stay and make it happen  the place where you was born  where you grew up then try to make it there . \\n it \\'s possible . \\n senegalese rappers are also identified by what they say in their tracks . \\n western hip - hop lyrics often revolve around the accumulation of material wealth and throwing parties . \\n pbs and other senegalese rap groups have different concerns . \\n in the grim lyrics to leboho inwa  the executioner is black . \\n pbs raps that africans are their worst enemies . \\n front man amidu E7284 may look like [he] got [his] moves on the streets of brooklyn but [his] critique of post-colonial finger pointing in africa tells a different story . \\n you know  in africa every time you know something bad happens  everybody like you know is because of the white man  you know the colonization  the slavery . \\n they do n\\'t realize that you know the real execution is really black \\'s black like them . \\n so before they say it is a white man tangle you know it \\'s because of a white man that this happens and they got to  you know  check around and they say who is the real guilty . \\n we got to accept it and try to  you know  change the things  make the things better . \\n positive black soul are now the oldsters of dakar \\'s hip - hop scene and they have established the template of social consciousness that many senegalese hip - hop groups follow like bootin bye  which recently scored this hit about aids prevention . \\n again amidu E7284 from postive black soul . \\n when we started there were maybe two or three hip - hop groups in dakar and now today we got more than 2000 groups only in dakar  let \\'s say in senegal . \\n two thousand hip - hop bands ? \\n hip - hop bands only in dakar  not the whole senegal . \\n so you know it is amazing . \\n it \\'s fantastic  extraordinary . \\n just how extraordinary can be heard on a recent E4077 recording . \\n the hop is a compilation featuring dakar \\'s biggest rap stars from bidu bubes to the current kings of senegalese hip - hop daura g . \\n that kind of success needs no translation . \\n for the world  i am E4263 warmen . \\n clashes continued today in the E4817 bank and gaza . \\n palestinian gunmen fired on an israeli car killing the driver . \\n earlier today israeli soldiers guarding a jewish settlement shot and killed a palestinian man who was later identified as an intelligence officer . \\n the israeli army said the man had been approaching the guard post in a suspicious manner . \\n in haiti  E6007 - E120 aristide has been declared the winner in last sunday \\'s controversial presidential election . \\n npr \\'s E242 hadden reports . \\n former president aristide won with 92 percent of the vote according to haitian election officials . \\n the sweeping victory was expected since aristide ran virtually unopposed . \\n opposition candidates boycotted the vote citing tainted legislative elections last E4615 . \\n aristide was elected president for the first time ten years ago and served just months before a military coup sent [him] into exile in the united states . \\n [he] now faces huge obstacles as haiti \\'s leader . \\n [his] country is the poorest in the hemisphere and much of the world community has shunned [him] . \\n on wednesday un secretary general kofi annan called on [his] organization to close its mission in haiti citing the unstable political climate . \\n though a spate of pre-election violence kept some haitians away from the polls on sunday  the voting itself went relatively smoothly . \\n E242 hadden  npr news . \\n this is the world . \\n i am E3345 kahn . \\n gao xingjian arrived in stockholm this week and when [he] leaves the chinese born writer will have something extra in [his] suitcase  the nobel prize for literature . \\n today gao  who now lives in E2648  gave the traditional nobel lecture as part of the festivities leading up to sunday \\'s ceremony  and on the same day [he] collects the prize . \\n gao \\'s 1989 novel ` soul mountain \\' will be published for the first time in america . \\n if you want to know what gao xingjian is all about  as a thinker and as an artist  our international book critic E5344 E4384 says gao \\'s masterpiece is an ideal starting point . \\n [his] politics are embedded in [his] writing and [his] writing is first and foremost a celebration of freedom . \\n this novel ` soul mountain \\'  which is just being released in the united states this week is in every possible way a celebration of what freedom means . \\n it \\'s a large novel  full of all kinds of ideas and incidents and stories and tales and a polyphony of voices . \\n it is  if you like  the whole world wrapped up in 500 pages . \\n it is the world at its most carnival - like  and yet it is virtually impossible  is n\\'t it  for a chinese artist to do something or to make a statement without its having some kind of either political effect or be political in origin . \\n i mean this man took the trip on which the novel was based for political reasons  did [he] not ? \\n certainly . \\n [he] is born in 1940 . \\n [he] is a product of the cultural revolution . \\n in fact [he] had to burn up an entire suitcase full of hundreds of poems and plays and stories at the start of the cultural revolution in fear of going to prison  and then in 1983 after being diagnosed with lung cancer  which had killed [his] father three years earlier and being convinced that [he] himself was going to die  [he] gets a kind of reprieve . \\n [he] gets a second chest x-ray  discovers that [he] does n\\'t have lung cancer  recognizes that by virtue of the kinds of things that [he] is writing  [his] openness to western literary ideas  that [he] is in political trouble again  and so [he] sets out on an extraordinary odyssey of some 15 kilometers  mostly on foot  which [he] takes through southwestern china . \\n [he] had survived  if you will  a death sentence  and now in that new freedom of the life in front of [him]  [he] takes to the road in the tradition of old chinese poets and records what [he] sees  what [he] hears  the stories that [he] is told . \\n the book is filled with marvelous descriptions of the gorges through which [he] walks  the mountains that [he] climbs  indeed the book is called soul mountain  the mountain on which [he] hopes in some way or another to get in touch with [his] soul  [his] individual soul  as opposed to that mass kind of soul being enforced upon [him] by the communist chinese authorities  the social realism that the cadres would have [him] write in . \\n not only can this fellow write  [he] can paint too  ca n\\'t [he] ? \\n [he] is best known among [his] neighbors in paris as a painter . \\n [he] has had more than 30 one - man shows and [his] paintings are quite delicately done and there [he] is also very well known as a playwright . \\n i think [he] has published about 18 plays now and [he] writes [his] plays in E4077 . \\n just one last thing quoting [him] and i wonder if you could respond to this  E5344  [he] said at the very beginning of [his] wonderful speech to the nobel prize committee  [he] said  `` i do not wish to waste this talk on literature by saying too much about politics and history  what i want to do is to use this opportunity to speak as one writer in the voice of an individual . \\'\\' \\n is that true basically not only for [him] that day  today  but of all of [his] work ? \\n well  the work that we have so far in english translation suggests that  and indeed this novel  which is a celebration as well of the self of the individual  goes so far as to even divide up to the self . \\n characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that at a certain point  you have a new [he]  you have a new [she]  you have a you  and each one of these characters tells stories  each story of which is designed to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in china . \\n E5344 E4384 is director

and information here on the voice of america . \\n i \\'m E6148 moralis along with E5249 E5392 on voa news now . \\n india has signed a series of deals with russia to acquire an aircraft carrier  fighter jets and tanks . \\n the deals were signed as russian president E5364 putin concluded [his] talks with indian leaders in new delhi . \\n the two countries also signed a strategic partnership agreement  obligating both countries to avoid joining political or military alliances against each other . \\n they also agreed to form a joint working group for mutual concerns on terrorism . \\n news now \\'s E4802 yakie spoke with our new delhi correspondent E1796 teeple about the russian leader \\'s visit and [his] comments about the situation in the disputed kashmir region . \\n [he] said exactly what the indians wanted to hear  which is that the dispute over kashmir between india and pakistan should be solved bilaterally and that there should be no outside interference  as [he] put it in this question . \\n now this is something the indians have been saying all along . \\n of course  pakistan wants international attention focussed on kashmir  and mr. putin also said that [he] supports india \\'s tough approach to the external violence in kashmir as [he] described it . \\n this is another thing that the indians were glad to hear [him] say  and [he] also said that both india and russia suffer from the same sort of terrorism  as [he] put it  referring of course to the separatist militancies in chechnya and russia and in jammu and kashmir . \\n so on balance i do n\\'t think that the indians heard anything from mr. putin that they did not want to hear . \\n what sort of hold does russia have on india and pakistan ? \\n russia has very little influence with pakistan  but of course russia supplies india with 70 % of its military hardware and that was of course the second pillar here of mr. putin \\'s visit  which was to finalize some very substantial arms deals . \\n in fact  we \\'re hearing that those deals have now been finalized  that russia will sell india 300 tanks  t - 90 tanks  very advanced tanks  that russia will also sell to india some sukoi - 30 bombers  fighter - bombers . \\n they are going to allow india to assemble about 140 of these bombers here in india  and they are also going to finalize a deal whereby india will acquire the admiral gorshkov . \\n that \\'s an old russian aircraft carrier that india has wanted to get for some time because india only has one other aircraft carrier  and this carrier in particular would allow the indian navy to extend its strategic strength much farther than it currently can now . \\n so indeed russia does have quite a bit of influence here . \\n these ties have gone way back  nearly 40 years  and they were strengthened considerably by this visit . \\n in fact both countries have now agreed to combat what they call terrorism with joint groups . \\n they have also set up a joint working group on afghanistan  which is of course a cause of concern for both countries . \\n mr. putin \\'s visit is the first by a russian leader in seven years . \\n why does the trip come now ? \\n well  [his] trip has actually been delayed for a couple of years . \\n russian president was supposed to visit india as early as 97 - 1998  but of course E3574 yeltsin \\'s health problems got in the way of that  and then of course  mr. yeltsin \\'s abrupt resignation last year another visit and then the subsequent election campaign and inauguration of E5364 putin took some time  so it \\'s been put off for a couple of years . \\n but there have also been a lot of delays in other areas . \\n these arms agreements that we were just speaking about have taken quite some time to finalize . \\n how does this visit by mr. putin compare to president E6074 \\'s visit earlier this year ? \\n that \\'s an interesting question because E5364 putin on wednesday addressed the indian parliament just as E5515 E6074 had done six months ago  and i think it \\'s safe to say that mr. putin actually probably accomplished more than mr. E6074 did in the hard concrete terms of arms sales and that sort of thing  but it was mr. E6074 that stole the indian lawmakers \\' hearts . \\n of course you will recall when [he] spoke to the parliament there was an ecstatic welcome for [him] . \\n the indian lawmakers were sort of clambering over each other to shake [his] hand as [he] left the parliament building . \\n there was none of that for mr. putin  but [he] did receive a very warm welcome  although most ordinary indians who were actually rather captivated by mr. E6074 \\'s visit did not really pay much attention to mr. putin \\'s visit . \\n in fact [his] visit has somewhat been ignored and in fact the main news story here in india has been sort of a local controversy over the roll - back of fuel prices rather than mr. putin \\'s visit  but [he] did do what [he] had to do and [he] certainly strengthened ties in a strategic sense between russia and india . \\n that \\'s voa correspondent E1796 teeple . \\n in a joint statement wednesday  india and russia called for further measures against afghanistan \\'s dominant taliban faction . \\n the statement accuses the taliban of supporting international terrorism . \\n the united states and the european union will start lifting economic sanctions against yugoslavia today . \\n among the sanctions imposed against the regime of former president slobodan milosevic during the fight over kosovo are an oil embargo and a ban on commercial air traffic . \\n E4077 foreign minister E2381 vedrine said sunday that relieving the pressure on belgrade \\'s devastated economy is the first step towards supporting the new president vojislav kostunica and reintegrating yugoslavia into a democratic europe . \\n israeli helicopter gunships struck palestinian targets in the E4817 bank and gaza strip  thursday . \\n israeli prime minister E5182 barak said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing of israeli soldiers . \\n this morning  the entire world was the witness of a cold - blooded brutal lynch of two or three israelis within a palestinian police station in ramallah in the palestinian - controlled territories . \\n late thursday  mr. barak invited likud opposition leader E715 E2217 to join [him] in a government of national emergency . \\n it was a visit by mr. E2217 to a jerusalem religious holy site that sparked the violence that began last month between israelis and palestinian protesters . \\n un secretary general kofi annan who is leading mediation efforts in the middle east urged palestinians and israelis  thursday to show restraint . \\n both E4576 \\'s E6623 E1383 and syria \\'s president bashar al - assad charged E7074 with insulting arabs and muslims by violating their rights at holy sites . \\n president E6074 has told a memorial service for the victims of the deadly bomb attack on the uss E5323 that justice will prevail . \\n mr.

30 taiwan expats in dongguan have in little more than a decade turned a county of banana and lichee plantations into a big city with exports behind only shenzhen \\'s and shanghai \\'s . \\n how has dongguan  this rising economic star  done it ? \\n what mix of sad and happy tales about taiwan firms does this city have to tell ? \\n it \\'s 10:00 at night  but the city of dongguan in guangdong province is still hopping . \\n cars clocking 80 kilometers an hour zip along roads that reveal hardly a trace of the farming villages that they linked not long ago . \\n taiwanese business people here run their factories like they drive their cars  in high gear . \\n the factories are lit up at night for overtime shifts . \\n  we do n\\'t take much of a break for the chinese new year \\'s holidays   says E6464 yeh  chairman of dongguan \\'s powin electric  which makes cable for the telecoms industry . \\n  by the morning of the third day we start up again with three shifts  just like any other day . \\n we ca n\\'t keep up with our orders and have got to squeeze five days of work into every 24 hours .  \\n in the busy fucheng district  you find the taiwanese bars  covered from door to rooftop with flashing lights \\n . \\n the lights  like the karaoke singing within them  pulsate until dawn no matter the season . \\n inside there is a raucous crowd . \\n a taiwanese businessman down from harbin boasts that [his] auto plant up in the northeast sits on a lot as vast as taipei city and has a green light to sell on the domestic market . \\n in another room a taiwanese businessman based in dongguan carouses with a party cadre from yunnan who is trying to attract investment . \\n ju gao - jeng  a former roc legislator who now has an academic post in beijing  is talking to a reporter from taipei about the roc presidential elections - a hot topic of conversation on both sides of the taiwan strait . \\n amid all the merrymaking  one gets a sense of what shanghai must have been like in the thirties . \\n in dongguan at the turn of the 21st century  however  it is the taiwanese business people who have been playing the leading roles . \\n high concentration of taiwan firms \\n before the 21st century had even arrived  a bright economic star had risen over southern china . \\n ever since economic reforms accelerated on the mainland when deng xiaoping made a tour of the south in early 1992  four southern cantonese cities - zhongshan  dongguan  shunde  and nanhai - have earned a reputation as the  four tigers  of guangdong province . \\n dongguan leads the pack . \\n  the year before last its total exports were third on the mainland  trailing only shenzhen \\'s and shanghai \\'s   says jiang suwu  a graduate of wuhan university \\'s chinese department who came south to work in the planning department of a taiwan firm in dongguan . \\n  it had more than 15 foreign  taiwan  and hong kong firms  and economic growth for that year reached 26 % .  \\n in ancient times dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort yang guifei . \\n just a little more than a decade ago dongguan was still a largely agricultural area  its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . \\n it has since been completely made over into a  boundless industrial park  with an area of 2 square kilometers  a population of more than 5 million  and more than 3 taiwan firms . \\n chang E1414 - wen  the chairman of the taiwan business association of dongguan -lrb- tbad -rrb-  says that development started in the late 1980s . \\n hong kong firms  with their proximity and fluent cantonese -lrb- also the local dialect in dongguan -rrb-  were first . \\n the taiwanese  first coming about 1989  followed . \\n each arrival seemed to bring many more on its heels . \\n taiwan firms are now the most important source of foreign investment in dongguan . \\n consider the booming electronics industry . \\n eighty percent of dongguan \\'s 1 computer - related companies are from taiwan  hong kong and macau . \\n in terms of production value  they account for at least half of this rmb 50 billion local industry . \\n dongguan holds the highest concentration of taiwan firms anywhere on the mainland . \\n according to tbad statistics  there are now 30 taiwanese companies on the mainland  -lrb- official prc statistics  which include service - industry firms  put the number at 45 -rrb- . \\n guangdong province can boast one - third of the total  of which 3 are in dongguan . \\n most of these are telecom  cable  plastics  shoes  electronics and electric machinery companies . \\n why has dongguan been such a magnet for taiwan firms ? \\n kao wen - lai points out that dongguan is strategically located between shenzhen and guangzhou -lrb- canton -rrb- and accessible to the entire E5616 river delta . \\n it is three hours by car to hong kong and one and a half hours by boat to humen . \\n when compared to shenzhen  moreover  land and labor in dongguan are cheap . \\n  the local cadres have been smart  providing all manner of land and tax incentives   says E2754 ming - chih  tbad \\'s secretary general . \\n two keys to the miracle \\n one afternoon in the days before the chinese new year  chinese businessmen wearing suits arrived at the people \\'s government administration building in dongguan \\'s qishi district . \\n after a long wait  they sat down at a table to negotiate with qishi \\'s communist party secretary  the district chief  and various staff from its foreign economic office . \\n qishi \\'s factory rents  electricity charges and land leases were all focuses of discussion . \\n tbad  as is frequently the case  introduced the two parties . \\n  the factory rent was set at rmb 8.00 -lrb- about nt$ 32 -rrb- a square meter . \\n the electricity charge was rmb .87 a kilowatt hour  and there were various tax incentives   explains E2834 jung - tuo  who notes there is still room for negotiation . \\n all in all  it was a very attractive package . \\n in 1990  E2834 went to malaysia thinking about opening a factory there  but [he] discovered that malaysia \\'s market was much smaller than the mainland \\'s and its labor costs twice as high . \\n the style of life was too different there  there was a language divide  and the roads were poor . \\n the mainland was a much better fit for [him] and [his] printed circuit boards company . \\n now  little more than a decade later  its 20 - 30 workers have grown to 2 . \\n the company is once again preparing to expand its physical plant . \\n [he] acknowledges that it was a risky move to come to mainland china  but  if you \\'re going to die  you might as well die among your own people .  \\n [he] traces [his] ancestry to guangdong and affirms that [his] decision to set up in mainland china  involves ethnic pride .  \\n although low land and labor costs are dongguan \\'s main attractions  taiwan firms also choose the locale for the networks of people and producers that have been built up among taiwanese in dongguan over the last ten years . \\n these two kinds of networks  says h.d. yeh - who served as tbad \\'s president for two terms - were instrumental in creating the  taiwanese economic miracle .  \\n h.d. yeh points out that competition in the 21st century is all about speed . \\n when customers in america make purchase orders  the whole process  including drawing up the contract and manufacturing the goods  requires four months . \\n but taiwanese firms can deliver in 15 days . \\n  there are two keys   [he] says . \\n  one is that all the upstream and downstream factories are here . \\n you can assemble a computer completely from parts made within 50 kilometers .  \\n and the second key is that when you deal with taiwanese companies  you do n\\'t have to endure a long contract process . \\n everything starts rolling with a single telephone call . \\n taiwanese business people are always playing golf  singing karaoke or chewing betel nut together . \\n  everyone is always asking how everyone else is doing - it \\'s a way of networking and building up good relations   yeh says . \\n E6464 yeh recalls that when the company first set up in dongguan in 1990   even screws had to be brought in from taiwan .  \\n but now the company sources virtually all of the necessary raw materials and parts on the mainland and is reliant for very little on taiwan . \\n  what does industrial emigration entail ? \\n usually it means downstream industries coming first  forcing the mid-stream industries to follow   says E2904 yang  deputy chairperson of tbad \\'s women \\'s division . \\n and in dongguan downstream taiwan firms have expanded into the mid-stream  becoming more vertically integrated . \\n tahsin printing only made paper boxes in taiwan but when they set up a plant in dongguan they discovered that it was hard to obtain the paper rolls they needed and thus learned how to make them themselves . \\n now the company makes paper boxes both from rolled paper and from colored flat paper . \\n to each its own domain \\n many companies have expanded into new business realms in dongguan . \\n a frequently cited example is primax  h.d. yeh \\'s electronics firm . \\n the company rented a factory in dongguan in 1989 and at first produced labor - intensive power surge protectors . \\n after three years  they began in 1992 to invest massively on the mainland  establishing computer mouse production lines . \\n thereafter  primax launched new products every year : cellular phone parts  overhead projectors  paper shredders  scanners . . . \\n constantly expanding its product lines and production capacity  primax expanded from a single dongguan plant with 25 workers in 1989 to its current nine factories and 4 - plus workforce . \\n primax \\'s performance  h.d. yeh notes  pushed its mother company in taiwan to go public seven years ago . \\n primax is one of the few taiwan electronics companies with a definite  china orientation .  \\n  it does n\\'t cost much to set up a factory in mainland china  and shipping times are stable . \\n these are helpful to the mother company both in terms of controlling costs and filling large orders   says yeh . \\n dongguan hsu fu chi foods  which sells candy  cakes and candied fruit in the mainland domestic market  is another good example . \\n they began production there in 1992  formally opening their own plant in dongguan in 1994 . \\n the company now has three factories in dongguan  with a combined area of 120 square meters  that produce 200 tons of candy  70 tons of chinese - style cakes  and 180 tons of gelatin and pudding a day . \\n  we produce 300 - 500 container loads of food a month . \\n you can find our cakes in supermarkets all the way from guangzhou to tibet .  \\n E6330 hsu  the company \\'s vice president  says that after one invests on the mainland  layouts of taiwan factories seem exceedingly cramped . \\n  there \\'s a totally different sense of space .  \\n  dongguan is by itself one - thirteenth the size of taiwan   notes E2754 ming - chih  secretary general of the taiwan business association . \\n in dongguan factories are more than ten times the sizes of similar plants in taiwan . \\n one factory building at the talingshan furniture plant is 380 meters long . \\n walking the perimeter of a leading electronics plant in qishi is  like playing four holes of golf .  \\n like soldiers  workers often have to take different shifts in the cafeteria . \\n the pouchen shoe plant  dongguan \\'s largest  employs 100 . \\n the compound has a nursery  hospital and an operating room . \\n  we always jokingly refer to it as fort pouchen   says yeh . \\n victory to the strivers \\n although the taiwan firms in dongguan have left home  their success can largely be attributed to an ethos they transplanted from taiwan - that  victory goes to those who strive the hardest .  \\n  in taiwan  we used to take the children somewhere fun on weekends and holidays   says chang E4487 - liang of tbad \\'s women \\'s division . \\n but since [she] \\'s moved the factory   there has n\\'t been a single meal the whole family has eaten together .  \\n if you want to open a plant on the mainland  you \\'re going to have to sacrifice family intimacy .  \\n in taiwan  a boss just has to set the factory \\'s basic course and at the very most supervise the executives   explains E2904 yang  the women \\'s division \\'s deputy chairperson . \\n  but on the mainland  a boss has to supervise everything : customs  tax payments  workers \\' disputes  meal preparation . . . . \\n there \\'s always the feeling that everyone will start to slack off once the boss leaves .  \\n all the job - related pressures and evenings out with fellow taiwanese business people or communist party cadres result in ill health for many taiwan business people on the mainland . \\n one of E2754 \\'s tasks as chairperson of tbad is to handle funeral arrangements for taiwanese business people there . \\n  many of them die suddenly   [he] says . \\n the association has been trying to promote healthier lifestyles . \\n  instead of just going out to karaoke bars and drinking  why not play golf too   recommends h.d. yeh . \\n dongguan has four or five golf courses within city limits . \\n about 1 people play every day  and 80 - 90 % of them are taiwanese . \\n the taiwanese entrepreneurial spirit has blossomed here by processing goods for export through hong kong in addition to making the most of connections between local taiwan firms . \\n with 3 taiwan - owned businesses here  and 10 - 20 taiwanese business people and their dependants coming in and out every day  the dong - guan area has already developed an economic circle in which taiwan firms can conduct most of their business among themselves . \\n in the vibrant district of houjian  there is an area that locals call taiwan E5862 . \\n a casual look around reveals shop signs familiar to any taiwanese : taichung E2406  ah - shui shih \\'s pig knuckle kingdom  yungho soy milk  the mantu hair salon . . . . and most of the customers are taiwanese . \\n restaurants serve up authentic taiwanese fare like  pineapples and bitter melon chicken  and  sesame oil chicken .  \\n in november 1998 global express  a taiwan firm  even opened up a shuttle bus to hong kong \\'s airport . \\n global express serves as a good example of taiwanese corporate agility . \\n originally  arrivals from taiwan en route to dongguan had to board buses run by a hong kong - based and mainland - financed travel agency . \\n  but we felt that the service left something to be desired  and that a lot of time would always be wasted while holders of \\' taiwanese compatriot visas \\' cleared customs   notes E5249 chang  global travel holding \\'s executive director . \\n two years ago  this taiwanese travel agency began to talk with the mainland customs and border inspection agencies and negotiated a deal to get the route . \\n  we tell taiwanese business people that riding our buses is safe  the service is good  and that it makes the trip through customs easy .  \\n in enemy territory \\n as soon as you \\'re through customs at hong kong  you see them : women draped with beauty pageant - like sashes with the chinese characters for  global travel  emblazoned across them . \\n pushing small luggage carts  they lead customers to the buses . \\n they have become a  must - see  tourist sight for taiwanese visitors to dongguan . \\n  at first we thought of talking with hong kong airport about renting a counter   explains chang . \\n  but for just one - fourth of a six square - meter booth  the rent comes to hk$ 200 .  \\n so the company thought that instead of spending that much money on a booth it made more sense to lower operating costs and pass these along in the form of lower fares for its customers . \\n they never expected that the luggage carts would in fact make it much easier for customers to find them in sprawling hong kong airport and would become an easily recognizable company trademark . \\n  now mainland chinese travel agencies have started copying the way we use the carts   says chang  laughing . \\n since global buses started plying this route in november 1988  daily bus departures have risen from 4 to 27  with over 20 riders a month . \\n global plans to introduce new services  including car rentals and plane ticket reservations and confirmations . \\n dongguan appears to have a bright future . \\n  the taiwan firms here now are powerful enough to get two or three members of the legislative yuan to represent their interests   holds one senior reporter . \\n although tbad \\'s yeh believes that investment prospects on the mainland are good  [he] does acknowledge the precariousness of their position in hostile territory . \\n taiwan business interests can not put down their guard . \\n because of taiwan \\'s experience with rapid modernization  many ccp cadres have sought employment with taiwanese firms  hoping to learn from the masters . \\n at the first opportunity  however  they leave to set up shop for themselves . \\n  the student then challenges the master   explains E2904 yang  detailing how these mainland upstarts go on to compete with the very taiwan firms that taught them all they know . \\n this scenario should be familiar to taiwanese . \\n  it happens in taiwan too .  \\n apart from keeping up their guard  it is even more important that taiwan firms raise their productivity and technological level . \\n  many manufacturers  even those in mainland china  will not survive   says yeh . \\n taiwan firms find it difficult to adjust to the instability of the mainland \\'s investment environment  as well as the laws there that seemingly change overnight . \\n the year before last the mainland announced a new tax system  under which raw materials imported by foreign firms would be taxed at a rate of 17 %  with 9 % being returned to the manufacturer when finished goods were exported . \\n  when i went to beijing to negotiate   recalls yeh   i asked cadres in the foreign trade office to consider the impact of the tax on the electronics industry . \\n profit margins are at best 3 - 5 % . \\n how can manufacturers afford to pay a 17 % import tax ?  \\n in E2265 of last year the prc authorities announced the  document # 35  rules . \\n these stipulated that companies would be given grades according to the quantity of their exports and their records of breaking customs regulations . \\n those meriting only a b would have to offer a deposit of 40 - 50 % against the value of their raw material imports . \\n this terrified taiwan firms in dongguan . \\n according to tbad \\'s statistics  75 % of the taiwanese firms were given bs . \\n the announcement caused quite a stir  but its effect on taiwanese investment is as yet unclear . \\n in E4684 of last year  as the mainland customs authorities took aggressive moves against smuggling  12 taiwan business people in dongguan were detained . \\n the charges ran the gamut from not filling out proper forms to purchasing phony export contracts and trying to pass them off to customs . \\n seven business people were arrested and charged with smuggling and are still in jail . \\n  i \\'m constantly thinking about them . \\n i \\'m meditating and have gone vegetarian  but i \\'m still not at peace   yeh says . \\n on the mainland  the highest penalty for smuggling is death . \\n  last year the mainland sent nine customs officers to the firing squad   notes yeh . \\n the fate of these taiwanese businessmen will depend entirely on the mainland \\'s political climate . \\n whether its arrival was by accident or design  a new age for taiwanese firms in dongguan is here . \\n it is a far cry from the days when taiwan firms enjoyed tremendous advantages . \\n from the various revisions to trade law adopted by the prc last year  chang E1414 - wen extrapolates that the prc both wants to protect its uncompetitive state firms and turn from low - tech processing to high - tech production . \\n  this is because state enterprises pressure the government with appeals about their right to survival   yeh says . \\n when foreign firms in the mainland are confronted with threats to their safety and property   hong kong can count on the cooperation of the government  us and japanese businesses can turn to their ambassadors  but what can taiwan firms do ?  asks yeh . \\n in dongguan they can help each other . \\n currently  more than 80 % of the 3 taiwanese firms in dongguan have joined tbad . \\n tbad has 29 local branches in dongguan and is  moreover  the only taiwan business association in mainland china with a women \\'s division . \\n E2390 companies listed on the taiex  including lite - on electronics and delta electronics  are members of tbad . \\n it is the largest and strongest of all taiwan business groups on the mainland both in terms of organization and operations . \\n many taiwanese believe that at a time of cross-strait tension  taiwan firms have made their own decisions to invest in the mainland and therefore should bear the risk themselves too . \\n and by investing their money  technology and so forth on the mainland  are they not to some degree abandoning taiwan ? \\n tbad takes issue with this view . \\n h.d. yeh points out that in 1998 taiwan had an overall trade surplus of us$ 5.9 billion  and a surplus of us$ 12.76 billion with mainland china . \\n if not for its trade with the prc  therefore  taiwan would have had a trade deficit . \\n  we make our money here  but we pay taxes in taiwan  and most of our families and children do most of their consumer spending in taiwan   insists tbad chairperson chang E4487 - liang . \\n chang notes that after the major earthquake in taiwan on september 21  taiwan business associations throughout mainland china contributed nt$ 60 million . \\n tbad contributed nt$ 30 million all by itself . \\n hence  [he] argues that it \\'s very unfair to say that taiwanese businesses in the mainland are n\\'t contributing to taiwan . \\n the question is  how should the roc government view taiwan firms in the mainland ? \\n and for that matter how is the prc government looking at the taiwanese in dongguan ? \\n tbad \\'s spiritual leader h.d. yeh often goes to beijing to represent taiwan firms in negotiations with the government . \\n once  in the presence of many communist party cadres  a high - ranking official of the state council \\'s taiwan affairs office asked [him] this question :  you \\'ve gathered so many taiwan firms in dongguan and stirred up such enthusiasm among them - but for what purpose ?  \\n it threw [him] for a loop . \\n yeh is still trying to figure out what the mainland authorities think of tbad . \\n for taiwan firms in dongguan  investing in mainland china is a road of no return . \\n  in recent years many taiwan business people have also tried to invest in vietnam  only later to close their factories there   says chang E1414 - wen . \\n mainland china shares the same language as taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions . \\n it would be surprising if it did n\\'t attract taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore . \\n amid the cross-strait political standoff  one can expect that taiwan firms in dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss . \\n -lrb- E6110 cheng / photos by diago chiu / tr. by E4912 E6651 -rrb- \\n source : taiwan business association of dongguan \\n graphic by tsai chih -

looking man .  \\n a person \\'s looks change with their age and their state of mind . \\n many friends have told me i look better the older i get . \\n people do n\\'t know that when i was young i had dreadful protruding teeth  but now not only do my teeth no longer show  but the lines of my face have also softened . \\n people who know me know that there have always been two great loves in my life : the news  and women . \\n now that i \\'m in my 80s  looking back i think i can say i \\'ve done alright in both respects  and i \\'ve learnt that both reporting the news well  and finding favor with women  depend on your character and conduct . \\n journalism is not just a profession  but should also be a vocation - you have to throw yourself fully into this infinitely broad field of endeavor . \\n intellectually and spiritually  in work and in love  i have gained experience and fulfilment . \\n i have always remembered the encouragement which mr. yu youren gave me as a young reporter . \\n [he] said that to be a fearless champion of social justice  as is expected of a journalist  the most important thing  apart from energy and vitality  is modesty . \\n you have to treat everybody the same  and not be overawed by the great and powerful . \\n a president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being  and should both be treated the same way . \\n funnily enough  an unassuming attitude is also advantageous in relations with the opposite sex . \\n chinese society is male dominated  and women are mostly regarded as having a subsidiary role . \\n in this kind of unfair situation  an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more . \\n a considerate attitude can be expressed in little things . \\n for instance  when you see that a hair has fallen onto a female friend \\'s shoulder  you should lightly pick it off for [her]  and throw it away or put it in your pocket . \\n if sincere  this kind of action is attractive in a man . \\n if a woman expresses [her] liking for you  then no matter whether [she] is pretty  or whether you find [her] attractive  you should respond in the same way  and with the same respect . \\n when i was a young reporter stationed in europe  there was a british woman reporter who liked me very much . \\n once i was driving [her] somewhere to report a story when we had an accident  and [she] suffered some badly broken bones . \\n although i was n\\'t attracted to [her] in that way  i went to see [her] every day in hospital  and this left a deep impression on [her] of how considerate chinese men can be . \\n looking back at my life  i \\'ve hardly had any really bad experiences in my relationships with women  and this is because just as in my professional life  i \\'ve always maintained a self - critical attitude towards my emotions  and always tried to prevent myself acting like a male chauvinist . \\n looks are something you are born with  but character is something you can work on  and it can outweigh your appearance . \\n luo jialun  one of the leading lights of the E4615 fourth movement  is a famous example . \\n luo was not good looking  and was even ridiculed as  looking like a cross between a pig  a dog and a bear .  \\n but [he] was tremendously well - read  had a beautiful writing style  and for a time [he] was chinese ambassador to india . \\n [his] wife was a universally admired beauty  the envy of all . \\n so i say   handsome is as handsome does .  \\n i was imprisoned by both the kuomintang and the communists  and at times i might have been killed . \\n perhaps other people in the same situation might have wallowed in self - pity  but i saw it as a rare opportunity in life . \\n in 1951  in a dark prison cell during a big communist purge  what came into my mind was not fear of death . \\n instead  i wondered what kind of headline my death would merit in the newspapers . \\n  10 rush to E5763 lu executed  ? \\n perhaps it was this eternal optimism which changed my frame of mind and my appearance . \\n this is the advice i \\'d like to give young people : \\n it \\'s true that good looks can come from external grooming  wearing nice clothes  or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people \\'s attention by creating your own special look . \\n but do n\\'t overdo it . \\n it is appropriate dress  and a temperament developed through study and practice  which really make a man attractive . \\n powerful tools for biotechnology - biochips \\n -lrb- chang chiung - fang / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by E3470 E547 -rrb- \\n the enterovirus detection biochip developed by dr. E3981 biotechnology takes only six hours to give hospitals the answer to whether a sample contains enterovirus  and if it is the deadly strain entero 71 . \\n worldwide  biotechnology is a rising star of the industrial stage . \\n in taiwan  in recent years the ministry of economic affairs  the national science council and the national health research institutes have been strongly pursuing  biochip  research programs . \\n in the last two years  three biochip companies have also been set up in taiwan . \\n just what are biochips ? \\n what use are they to mankind ? \\n why do so many people have such confidence in their future ? \\n what is the current state of this field in taiwan ? \\n and what are the prospects for future development ? \\n let \\'s take a closer look . \\n in just a few years \\' time  or a few decades  the following scenario could become a reality : \\n when you \\'re feeling under the weather  all you need to do is buy a diagnostic biochip from the chemist \\'s shop  put a drop of urine onto it  and you will find out what is wrong with you - a health check will be as easy as a pregnancy test today . \\n everyone will carry with them a biochip bearing a record and analysis of their own dna . \\n from it one will not only be able to see one \\'s own physical condition  but even to predict what diseases one will have in the future . \\n it will be like an id card  needed when looking for work  buying insurance or even seeking a partner for love and marriage . \\n laboratories will no longer need all kinds of large instruments  for all stages of their experiments will be carried out on little biochips  saving time  effort and money . \\n today  the scenes outlined above may just seem like pipe dreams . \\n but these dreams could yet come true  and the key to that happening is those little biochips . \\n a dream come true ? \\n developments such as the sequencing of the human genome and the rapid development of genetic engineering have spawned biotechnology industries like bioinformatics  biomaterials and pharmaceutical engineering  which have emerged as the rising stars of 21st - century industry . \\n as part of the government \\'s efforts to promote the biotechnology industry in taiwan  in july 1999 the industrial technology research institute -lrb- itri -rrb- set up the biomedical engineering center -lrb- bmec -rrb- to actively develop biomedical engineering technologies . \\n biochips are one of the core technologies in the field . \\n bmec general director dr. johnsee E1715 says that the itri \\'s four - year r&d program in biochip applications and technology is now in its second year . \\n its initial objectives are mainly focused on developing sensor chips to screen for infectious diseases  while later goals will be to develop technologies to test for genetic diseases and cancers . \\n as well as this new research establishment  in the two years since september 1998 three commercial companies have been set up in taiwan to make biochips : u - vision biotech  taiwan genome sciences and dr. E3981 biotechnology . \\n of these  dr. E3981 attracted much attention this year when it developed a chip to detect enteroviruses  a deadly epidemic of which has gripped taiwan over the last two years . \\n fever chips \\n dr. E3981 bio-technology was set up in september 1998 . \\n vice president E2834 shin - hwan states that the company successfully applied to the ministry of economic affairs for funding to help it pursue a development program for enterovirus detection chips and test technology . \\n today  the enterovirus chip is in the testing phase  and dr. E3981 is collaborating with taipei veterans general hospital to obtain samples with which to establish the accuracy of the chip . \\n what is so remarkable about the enterovirus detection chip when compared with traditional test methods ? \\n there are 68 known forms of non-polio enterovirus . \\n the detection chip does not simply determine whether a person is infected with enterovirus  but can also differentiate between different virus groups  for instance showing whether a sample contains the deadly entero 71 virus  or coxsackie a16  which is easily confused with entero 71 . \\n in addition  the chip and its accompanying pcr kit greatly reduce the time required for testing . \\n E2834 shin - hwan notes that traditional bacterial and viral cultures take seven to ten days to prepare  and even with the newer molecular biology testing techniques it takes three days to get a result . \\n but dr. E3981 has developed methods to reduce the sample preparation time  which enables a result to be obtained in only six hours when used in combination with their enterovirus chip . \\n furthermore  the initial results of joint trials by dr. E3981  chang gung university and national cheng kung university suggest that the chip is over a thousand times more sensitive than traditional test methods . \\n  in addition to enterovirus  we plan to develop chips to detect other infectious diseases such as hepatitis b  hepatitis c and hiv   says E2834 shin - hwan . \\n apart from the enterovirus chip  which is already at the testing stage  the itri \\'s molecular biomedical technology division is also conducting research and development on biochip applications and technology . \\n research program director pan chao - chi states that at present they are actively developing a  fever chip  with a wide range of applications . \\n pan explains that in clinical practice  the causes of fever are difficult to quickly diagnose . \\n a  fever chip  bearing the dna of common fever - causing viruses and bacteria could be used to determine the cause of the fever and the type of pathogen involved would be a valuable tool . \\n however  pan points out that because of the difficulties in substantially reducing the time needed for sample preparation  the usefulness of such a fever chip is still limited  so that it can not yet be widely promoted . \\n where the real money is \\n at present  most applications for biochips are in academic research and the development of new pharmaceutical drugs . \\n demand for them is growing rapidly . \\n johnsee E1715 says that according to us market research estimates  the worldwide annual consumption of microarray chips is currently around 250 ; in two years this is expected to grow to 1.2 million . \\n based on a market price per chip of us$ 1  the size of the world market in biochips could grow to us$ 1.2 billion in 2003  and to us$ 40 billion over the next decade . \\n thus some people have set their sights on the biochip market  and believe that following taiwan \\'s success in the semiconductor field  the island could go on to be a major center for contract manufacture of biochips . \\n be that as it may  the small number of biochip companies so far established in taiwan still find their market in domestic research establishments and pharmaceuticals manufacturers . \\n although they are also actively developing overseas markets  what interests them most is not biochips per se  nor are they content merely to be contract manufacturers . \\n  the chips are only a tool  and the big money is not in chip sales . \\n what counts is the r&d behind them .  \\n E242 huang  executive vice president of u - vision biotech  reveals that u - vision  which was set up in september 1999  has signed a contract with the us company zen - bio to jointly develop human adipocyte cdna microarray chips . \\n huang states that research in recent years has revealed that adipocytes -lrb- fat cells -rrb- are active regulators of the energy balance in the body  and play an important role in disorders such as obesity  diabetes  osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease . \\n thus it is hoped that research into human adipocytes can help in the search for drugs and other therapies to treat these disorders . \\n apart from this  u - vision is also conducting a one - year bacterial genome project  which aims to map the genome of a certain drug - resistant bacterium as a basis for developing new vaccines and drugs . \\n drug development \\n taiwan genome sciences -lrb- tgs -rrb-  which was set up in november 1999 as a joint venture by the uni-president enterprises group  yuen foong yu and tuntex groups  only entered the biotechnology fray in E4397 of this year . \\n ceo E6464 kuo says the investors came to the view that taiwan needs to develop its biotechnology industries  and therefore they combined their resources to make a long - term investment in the field . \\n tgs \\'s strategy is to invest in a number of us genome research companies  and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with them . \\n kuo comments that contract production of chips is merely a service activity and a source of income for the company - tgs \\'s ultimate goal is in doing r&d work to identify gene sequences as targets for developing new drugs . \\n kuo states that at present  the number of known target sequences for disease - treating drugs is only around 500  but as the human genome is mapped out this number can be expected to increase tenfold . \\n currently  tgs has its sights set mainly on doing research into diseases which are especially prevalent in E3336  such as liver and stomach cancers . \\n a chip revolution \\n however  the potential uses for biochips go far beyond the medical applications outlined above . \\n dr. johnsee E1715  who as well as heading up the biomedical engineering center is also general director of union chemical laboratories  a research institute under the itri umbrella  says that due to biochips \\' advantages of miniaturization  parallelism  speed and the ability to reveal the  big picture   they have a very wide range of applications . \\n they can not only be used as a research tool in biological  medical and pharmaceutical research and development  and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks  testing for infectious pathogens  screening blood and so on  but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications  police forensic work  environmental testing and food testing . \\n biochips come in two main types : the microfluidics chip or  lab - on - a - chip   and the microarray chip or  dna chip .  \\n microfluidics chips bring together biotechnology  microelectronics  micromachining and other technologies to integrate the functions of multiple laboratory instruments onto a single chip in miniaturized form . \\n meanwhile on microarray chips  biological molecules such as gene segments  oligonucleotides  proteins or antibodies are bound to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots  and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots . \\n bmec researcher pan chao - chi uses the example of blood screening for a blood bank to illustrate the difference between the two kinds of chips . \\n to test a blood sample using a microarray chip  the sample must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification  nucleotide extraction  copying  amplification and labeling before being put onto the chip where the  hybridization  reaction takes place . \\n finally  the results are analyzed using a detection system . \\n hence these chips are only suitable for use in the laboratory . \\n in contrast  with a lab - on - a - chip system  all the laboratory preparation stages will be done on the chip itself  so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto the chip to obtain a result . \\n at present  microfluidics technology is not yet mature  and no such chips have been launched as commercial products anywhere . \\n but  says pan chao - chih :  this is the way future biochip development will go .  \\n the poor man \\'s chip \\n future prospects also seem infinite for microarray chips  which are already widely used in laboratories and research establishments . \\n E242 huang notes that dna chips are an indispensable research tool in molecular biology . \\n on one little biochip  tens of thousands of gene segments can be arranged to simultaneously detect the expression of tens of thousands of genes . \\n in other words  whereas in the past researchers had to investigate each gene individually  today  using biochips  they can obtain test results for tens of thousands of genes at once . \\n in particular  biochips not only can speed the pace of research  but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments  with tests being carried out directly on human genes on the chip . \\n thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick  but also more humane . \\n dr. konan peck  an assistant research fellow at academia sinica \\'s institute of biomedical sciences -lrb- ibms -rrb-  says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool . \\n with this in mind  peck has developed nylon - based biochips which have been called  the poor man \\'s biochip   since they cost a third less than glass chips . \\n apart from the material itself being cheaper  the nylon chips use a visible - spectrum colorimetric system to display results  so that they can be read using an ordinary optical scanner  which costs 50 - 70 % less than using a special laser detector . \\n the nylon membrane biochips currently produced by tgs and u - vision biotech are all derived from the technology developed by konan peck . \\n cutting edge \\n can taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry  to become a major production center for biochips ? \\n bmec director johnsee E1715 observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required for biochip production is very high  so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited . \\n however  due to taiwan \\'s early entry into biochip research and development  and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry  the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills . \\n thus  says E1715   taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer .  \\n the potential and importance of biochips is plain to see  but in this new  interdisciplinary industry  there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome . \\n apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature  and that generally accepted  mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged  the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field  which limit the avenues available to each player . \\n  because this area is a patents minefield  it \\'s impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n\\'t infringe on anyone else \\'s patents   says johnsee E1715 . \\n in [his] view  this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players . \\n in other words  at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development  and obtain international patents  in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations . \\n at present  the bmec has over 10 patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips  chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications . \\n pushing the envelope \\n although at their present stage of development  biochips are already a great help to researchers  they are still far removed from ordinary people \\'s lives . \\n but one day they will play an important role in all our lives . \\n  applications and commercialization are our goal   says johnsee E1715 . \\n [he] says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback . \\n equally  to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher  and into hospitals  clinics and homes  and to individual users . \\n E1715 points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing  sample preparation needs to be made convenient  reading results must be simple and easy  the chips \\' speed and accuracy must be high  and their cost must be low . \\n [he] predicts that in one to two years  biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests  and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today . \\n ibms associate research fellow konan peck agrees that in the foreseeable future  diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future . \\n but in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology  the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable . \\n mankind is always challenging [his] limits  and when  in the near future  biochips lift the veil of many diseases  the next challenge will have only just begun . \\n turning to the constitution on the  one china  issue \\n still wrestling with the vexed issue of  one china   the president \\'s advisory group on cross-strait relations met for its sixth and seventh sessions during november  amid frenzied media attention . \\n the group eventually reached a consensus that the  one china  principle advocated by the mainland should be addressed  in accordance with the constitution .  \\n how president E2754 shui - bian responds to this proposal will determine whether or not the  one china  stalemate can be broken  and if there is to be a set timetable for implementing the three direct links . \\n after assuming the presidency  E2754 shui - bian recruited a number of leading politicians  industrialists  academics and other personages for a non-partisan advisory group  intended to build cross-party consensus on the subject of relations with the mainland . \\n chaired by academia sinica president E1715 yuan - tseh  the presidential advisory group on cross-strait relations first met in early september . \\n since then the group has held a series of intensive discussions on taiwan \\'s fundamental position regarding the cross-strait relationship . \\n the group entered the final phase of discussions on the  one china  issue during november  but differences between pro-unification and pro-independence participants continued to stymie the effort to produce a statement acceptable to all . \\n as dpp legislator shen fu - hsiung pointed out  the group had to draft something  palatable both to the pro-unification and pro-independence camps ; something which the dpp ca n\\'t shun and yet which does n\\'t make beijing wince .  \\n clearly no easy task . \\n on the evening of november 18 advisory group chairman E1715 yuan - tseh  meeting over dinner with dpp faction leaders  described the cross-strait situation as extremely precarious  and said that since time is not on taiwan \\'s side we need to step up efforts to resume dialogue with the mainland . \\n separately  during [his] report to the legislative yuan on the academia sinica \\'s budget  E1715 reiterated :  if the whole population could arrive at a consensus on \\' one china  \\' then president E2754 would have no grounds for not accepting that consensus .  \\n E1715 added that [he] hoped the advisory group would shortly come to a firm conclusion on the  one china  issue . \\n E1715 yuan - tseh \\'s appeal made little impression on the governing dpp  however . \\n furthermore  dpp chairman E2204 hsieh himself came under fire within the party after stating :  the constitution of the roc is itself a one china framework . \\n since the dpp has participated in the process of constitutional amendment it ought to accept this constitution  and as the party of government we ca n\\'t afford to override or reject it .  \\n according to dpp lawmaker E7528 cho - shui  E2754 shui - bian has shown more goodwill to beijing as president than E1715 teng - hui ever did  but without any response - \\n so why should [he] once again be expected to respond on the  one china  issue ? \\n also  E7528 disagrees with E1715 yuan - tseh \\'s assertion that  time is not on our side   and instead feels that things are no worse than before . \\n meanwhile  the opposition alliance has been calling for the dpp to  shed its ideological baggage .  \\n on november 24 the new party  which had already pulled out of the advisory group  published an article in the press signed by leading members such as yu mu - ming and E2754 kui - miao  in which they called on the government to take the constitution as its starting point for breaking the  one china  deadlock . \\n they pointed out that E2754 and the dpp had competed in elections in accordance with the constitution  winning the presidency and a share of seats in the legislature and the national assembly  and had also participated in the process of revising the constitution . \\n now  with its constitutionally granted mandate  the party has an obligation to fully uphold the constitution . \\n as the politicians argued  formosa plastics boss E2834 yung - ching convened a meeting with other captains of industry to come up with some advice for the government on economic policy . \\n for the first time E2834 voiced support for E1715 yuan - tseh \\'s proposal that  with \\' one china \\' as the precondition  each side can have its own interpretation .  \\n E2834 also agreed with E1715 \\'s notion that time is running out for taiwan  in the belief that taiwan will only have time on its side once it starts to carry out well - intentioned engagement with the mainland . \\n consensus on the  one china question  is an urgent priority for both sides if there is to be a peaceful future . \\n E2834 yung - ching \\'s demand for a review of the government \\'s  go slow  policy  and opening of the three direct links  brought a personal phone call from the president  who invited [him] to come and discuss policy . \\n on november 25 E2834 and a handful of other leading industrialists went to call on the president at [his] official residence . \\n the businessmen said that shelving the  one china  issue was not the right thing for the government to do  and that taiwan could no longer afford to play word games . \\n they stressed the need for early restoration of the mechanism for cross-strait economic dialogue  and said that the government should also think about moving towards political dialogue . \\n the presidential advisory group met again on november 26  and discussed a proposal  made earlier by public television system chairman wu feng - shan and already favored by most members of the group  for  one china  to be addressed through  three acknowledgements and four suggestions .  \\n a firm consensus was finally arrived at  and the group submitted to the president its proposal that taiwan should  respond to the mainland \\'s \\' one china \\' proposition in accordance with the constitution of the roc .  \\n the government and opposition parties continued to disagree regarding this consensus . \\n dpp legislator E7528 cho - shui described it as  acceptable  if not very satisfactory .  \\n pfp spokesman li ching - an called it  a conclusion without a conclusion .  \\n new party convenor hau lung - pin said the statement was too ambiguous  tending towards  one china  with each side free to make its own interpretation   and added that it was highly unlikely to be used by the president as a guide for cross-strait policy . \\n ting shou - chung  deputy executive director of the kmt policy committee  said this so - called consensus was simply a case of going round and round on the spot  and would do nothing to solve the core problem . \\n in a november 28 press release  the mainland affairs council -lrb- mac -rrb-  the government body in charge of cross-strait affairs  diplomatically stated that it would observe and implement the suggestions of the advisory group if and when they become official government policy . \\n speaking on the topic of the three direct links  mac chairwoman tsai ing - wen said that these will be phased in according to conditions  with the first phase being the opening of direct business links as necessitated by the admission of both sides to the wto . \\n and according to economics minister E7528 hsin - yi  the government recognizes that the  go slow  policy needs to be relaxed  and will give a more thorough accounting of this before the end of the year . \\n tanshui : an inspiration to poets  artists  and romantics \\n -lrb- E7528 i - hsien / photos by diago chiu / tr. by E5071 newell -rrb- \\n in paintings  a white cloud layer swirls over mt. kuanyin ; \\n waves on the river drift like a breeze ; \\n a red sun dances on golden water ; \\n a yellow moon sings from a deep purple sky . . . . \\n the tanshui of illustrations is a place of unblemished beauty  a myth that remains unshakeable . \\n in the 300 - plus years since its founding  this port town - formerly called huwei  now tanshui township - has seen days of prosperity and has also been through a baptism of fire . \\n what makes it special among the 309 urban and rural townships of taiwan ? \\n how do the people of tanshui live today ? \\n how do they recall the past ? \\n and how do they see the future ? \\n  you want to know how tanshui has changed ? \\n i would say that the biggest change is that the old streets are gone .  \\n so declares tu hsiu - yuan  proprietor of the hui yuan pharmacy  and also director of the huwei cultural and historical workshop . \\n [his] pharmacy is located on what is now called chungcheng road  one of the oldest streets  which tanshui natives still call huwei street . \\n tu  who has lived [his] whole life in the old neighborhood  has watched from [his] doorstep as old shops have refurbished themselves in modern style  and modern shops have adopted the look of the old . \\n for the convenience of cars  the streets have been widened repeatedly . \\n in 1988  the last train on the old tanshui line of the railroad chugged into history  taking that old slower pace of life with it . \\n in 1997 the tanshui line of the mass rapid transit system opened  bringing floods of visitors to the town . \\n yet  while these tourists bring a human touch to the streets on weekends and holidays  on ordinary weekdays the silence is accompanied only by leftover garbage  empty shops  and those huwei people who refuse to leave their old homes . \\n the golden age of huwei \\n there are different explanations as to the origins of the word huwei  the original name for tanshui . \\n some say it was a transliteration of the place name used by the indigenous people . \\n but others say it comes from a long - gone fishing practice  using a shi hu -lrb-  stone pool  -rrb- . \\n early fishermen used stones to carve a long  narrow catchment -lrb- the so - called  pool  -rrb- in the sand  waiting for the tide to carry in fish which they could then easily scoop up . \\n since the place now known as tanshui was at the tail end -lrb- wei -rrb- of this stone pool  it came to be called huwei . \\n tanshui occupied an important place in the transport network connecting taiwan to southeast E3336 . \\n even before the arrival of westerners in taiwan  E1414 chinese often crossed over from china to tanshui  which is relatively close to the mainland . \\n here they engaged in barter trade with the pingpu -lrb- meaning  plains  -rrb- aborigines  with deer skins and sulphur being the most coveted products . \\n as western powers turned their eyes to E3336  tanshui became strategically important . \\n in the 17th century  first the spanish  and then the dutch  built forts here as symbols of their claims to territorial control . \\n in the mid-17th century  china took control of taiwan  and closed tanshui to international trade . \\n later  as a result of the sino - E4077 war of 1884  tanshui was again opened up to western access . \\n during tanshui \\'s golden age  large and small boats were constantly coming and going in the harbor  and it was not unusual to see enormous steamships . \\n in the latter part of the qing dynasty  tanshui was the largest port in taiwan  and was the  customs headquarters   also charged with overseeing port activities at keelung  tainan  and kaohsiung . \\n however  during the japanese occupation  as a result of silting  and because the japanese invested a huge effort in developing the port at keelung  tanshui faded in importance  never again to see the likes of its glory days . \\n tanshui is a place of many historic sites  a place that invites reflection on things past . \\n in the  foreign district   a missionary named E861 mackay established the first hospital for western medicine in taiwan ; it was here that in 1878 the first case of paragonimiasis in the world was diagnosed . \\n the old church next to the hospital is a mecca for tanshui painters . \\n the schools  homes  and consulates in the foreign district - some long gone  some still standing - testify to the fact that this was a place of intensive interaction between chinese and western cultures . \\n if you go up sanmin street  you will discover the head of an old and disused water pipe . \\n this could be a relic left behind by one of the major japanese infrastructure projects  the first tap water station . \\n or you could walk instead next to the mrt station and see another first for taiwan : the first seaplane landing area  also built in the japanese occupation era . \\n or you could visit the venerable tamkang secondary school . \\n as you watch the children laughing and arguing and playing  you can think back to the time when the japanese government did not allow taiwanese and japanese to attend school together . \\n under those circumstances  tamkang middle school became a cradle for the training of taiwanese elites . \\n gradually you will discover that tanshui is a bookish place . \\n this little town has everything from nursery schools to graduate schools . \\n during the reign of the guangxu emperor of the qing dynasty -lrb- which began in 1875 -rrb-  and prior to the beginning of the japanese occupation in 1895  tanshui produced two successful candidates in the highest level military exam  one in the highest level civil exam  and countless successes in lower - level imperial exams . \\n even in modern times  the town has not passed up chances to embrace knowledge : when the idea of founding E7130 - kang university in tanshui was going to be abandoned because of a lack of land and money  local residents offered cheap land  donated money  and lobbied so that the university could set its roots in town . \\n these historic sites are near the river  but do n\\'t spend all your time there . \\n do n\\'t forget the tatun mountains  which shelter the town . \\n in the old days  tanshui folk who cultivated farms on the slopes had to walk for an hour to get to their crops . \\n these days you can take a local mini-bus . \\n in the mountains you will see the occasional terraced field grown over with weeds . \\n this land  which has gone from grass to grain and back to grass again  is where many an old tanshui native played when they were children . \\n the tanshui mystique \\n the mountains are also filled with old stories . \\n the often - renovated hsing chung tang shop is more than a century old . \\n owner li yung - kun is a descendant of the eminent li family of tanshui  which produced three juren -lrb- a successful candidate in provincial - level exams  held every three years -rrb- . \\n the house testifies to this past : it has a swallow - tailed roof and a flagpole  features that only the home of a juren was entitled to have . \\n li mingbin -lrb- whose name by birth is li minghui -rrb-  a scholar from beijing university currently working at chinese culture university on an exchange program  is a descendant of the juren li yingzhen  who was wounded resisting the japanese occupation and fled to the mainland  where [he] settled down . \\n like [his] elders  li mingbin bridges the gap across the taiwan strait  as [he] is capable of conversing fluently in either beijing dialect or the southern fujian dialect used in taiwan . \\n of course  stories do n\\'t have to be old to be interesting . \\n today \\'s tanshui residents are living their own stories . \\n the crotchety but modest guy who delivers the newspapers  the seafood restaurant owner who has made [his] fortune from scratch  the old man at the roadside food stall  the hostess in the tea house greeting and sending off guests . . . . \\n some are active in the early morning  some late at night . \\n though the founders of many of these shops have passed away  the second generation has taken the baton . \\n in the old bamboo tea shop  the now elderly hostess still plays [her] role amidst the ambience of wine and tea  offering a feminine presence to help put at ease [her] customers who come looking for a little relaxation  evoking the bewitching atmosphere of tanshui at night . \\n businessmen from outside  smelling profits  have set up gaudy storefronts and neon signs  hoping to trade on tanshui \\'s mystique to sell coffee  seafood  antiques  and snack foods . \\n students  who have enough money to keep several streets of shops going  carelessly wheel their motorcycles through the narrow streets  their minds elsewhere  thinking of youthful fun or romance . \\n E6224 couples and jilted lovers line the river  displaying their joy or sadness in their postures : two people \\'s shadows are melted together by the darkened river behind  while others stand alone on the riverbank like statues . \\n the weeping river \\n have you heard of the weeping junks ? \\n during the sino - E4077 war  taiwan governor liu mingchuan  attempting to obstruct a E4077 landing  scuttled several of these boats . \\n it is said that  late at night  the sunken junks make moaning sounds . \\n but i think that it may be the river itself that is moaning . \\n in 1998  the government produced a plan for a riverside expressway to tanshui . \\n the road  which was expected to have three levels  would have cut through rare mangroves and created a barrier between the river and the town of tanshui . \\n if the plan had been implemented  people who wanted to go to tanshui and gaze out over the river would have had to find some very high vantage point in town to do so ! \\n fortunately  thanks to efforts by cultural and environmental activists from tanshui  the plan was first postponed  and then was ultimately killed after an environmental impact assessment released in september refused to approve the scheme . \\n but a question remains : is something like this bound to come sooner or later ? \\n  for the purposes of development  the tanshui coast has been constantly exploited . \\n but what will be result of this incessant struggle against nature ?  says an agitated tu hsiu - yuan . \\n and hsieh teh - hsi of the tamsui culture foundation adds :  high - rises are going up one after another in tanshui new E5862 [ a huge government - planned development ]  but many of the apartments remain empty . \\n everybody here knows that when the northeast winds blow in during the winter  that is the coldest place around . \\n no wonder those apartments are not selling !  \\n tu says  with disbelief and exasperation in [his] voice :  do you know that they are going to build a huge bridge between tanshui and pali ? \\n it \\'s such a beautiful and historic location  but they are just going to stick up a bridge there  and they are even talking about having a rotating restaurant on top !  \\n lovers of tanshui  while keeping close watch over [her]  are fearful that the giant beast of development may eventually come and bulldoze tanshui away one piece of land at a time . \\n they fear that their children  like they themselves  will have to search through photographs and memories to find tanshui \\'s traditional simplicity and the joys of being close to nature . \\n when the old buildings are gone  and people lose contact with the great outdoors  will tanshui even be worthy of its reputation anymore ? \\n scattered wooden fishing boats bob in the river . \\n i have n\\'t met any of the fishermen who these days go out and catch only small fry . \\n they might relate how in the old days they could just put a hand in the river and come up with a big catch . \\n the lonely fishing boats are waiting for the tanshui -

feng / photos by E6888 E7528 / tr. by E5344 macdonald -rrb- \\n even if the township of linpien does n\\'t have a monopoly on the cultivation of  black pearl  wax apples  it was orchards in the linpien locality that earned black pearls their national renown . \\n a little town formerly notorious for its ground subsidence problem  linpien is now turning itself into one of southern taiwan \\'s premier tourist attractions . \\n the impetus for this change has come chiefly from local historians  along with various voluntary groups . \\n just before christmas break  the rural township of linpien  on the pingtung plain at the mouth of the linpien river  held its first ever wax apple festival . \\n the festival  in the town \\'s riverside park  was held to promote black pearl wax apples and celebrate the local volunteer spirit . \\n it was a scorching hot day  and heavily perspiring visitors were to be seen wandering among the stalls  lugging bags of wax apples and commenting on their remarkable sweetness . \\n  there \\'s a lot more than you \\'d think to growing wax apples   says local farmer E2754 sheng - tzung . \\n  how you take care of the orchards  which equipment you use - it all has an affect on the shape and texture of the fruit .  \\n prices for wax apples range widely  from around 3 pounds for nt$ 100 to nt$ 150 a pound . \\n fruit that shows a hint of black through the red color of the skin fetches the best price . \\n huang wan - fu  whose family farms two hectares of orchard with more than 700 wax apple trees  and who has over 30 years \\' experience as a fruit grower  says that while other parts of pingtung county also grow wax apples   linpien stands out for its growing techniques  developed through trial and error by the growers themselves  and for vernalization rates of up to 90 % .  \\n ugly duckling no more \\n the wax apple is a tropical fruit originating from the malay peninsula . \\n the dutch brought it to taiwan from java  in the 17th century  and it became commonly grown as a shade - giving tree . \\n old folk in the south remember when wax apples were  just something to munch on  - the kind of fruit that grew freely and that you could help yourself to . \\n but wax apples have increased in value during the past 30 years  thanks to advances in the way that they are grown . \\n for example  the  bag - wrap  method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds  but once it was introduced to linpien  in around 1994  farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous  shiny - looking wax apples  with less pesticide on the skin . \\n the method soon caught on throughout the district . \\n another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields . \\n this reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the trees  causing nutrients from the leaves and branches to be diverted into producing fruit . \\n the net - covered trees blossom earlier and produce more fruit . \\n as a result of this technique  black pearl wax apples are now available throughout most of the year . \\n the  black pearl  tag did n\\'t originate in linpien  but it was linpien wax apples that made the variety famous and prompted the dramatic growth of its market . \\n in 1983 the then - provincial governor E1715 teng - hui visited the town and praised the quality of its black pearl wax apples  so assuring the renown of the fruit . \\n subsequently  as president  E1715 teng - hui often gave gifts of black pearl wax apples to foreign dignitaries . \\n green hills \\n the success of black pearl wax apples gave linpien a much - needed boost  bringing some of the younger generation back to the area to grow the fruit . \\n the credit for putting wax apples at the heart of the town \\'s revival and for mounting the wax apple festival belongs with a group of volunteer workers - local people committed to the town \\'s regeneration . \\n how does a small town like linpien come to be home to such a well - organized volunteer effort  and just how did the volunteers set about giving their town a make - over ? \\n the story begins with the town \\'s riverside park . \\n the road linking the town \\'s main street with the riverside park  where locals like to stroll and chat at the beginning and end of the day  used to be overgrown and lined with trash . \\n now  however  thanks to a coordinated effort involving volunteers  residents and landlords  the verges are planted with sunflowers and lantana  while a former mud patch  donated rent - free by its owner  has been converted into a carp - filled lotus pool . \\n the revamping of linpien started eight or nine years ago  when schoolteacher tsao chi - hung - now a dpp deputy in the national legislature - along with fellow members of the linpien residents \\' democracy association launched a program to sweep the streets and keep the riverbank clean . \\n wu wu - ta  a plumber who runs the democracy association  says :  people were already doing their bit for the community over ten years ago  but not openly . \\n they swept the streets before dawn because they did n\\'t want people to see them and call them crazy .  \\n it was only three years ago  with the founding of the non-political linpien natural history conservation association  that residents began to publicly support the project . \\n the flood - prone linpien river has been dyked and dredged since the japanese colonial era  but the bare concrete embankments never did much for the scenery . \\n in 1999 tsao chi - hung learned that the water conservancy bureau was planning to renovate the flood defenses  and [he] proposed a scheme for  greenification  of the riverside area . \\n objections were raised  however  with some pointing out that the site  if left untended  could easily get overgrown and become a breeding ground for snakes and vermin . \\n the issue was discussed and finally the bureau agreed to let volunteers maintain the riverside area for two years . \\n if the scheme did n\\'t work out then the bureau would concrete over the site as originally planned . \\n following the lead of the conservation association and the democracy association  various volunteer groups in the district - including the senior citizens \\' club  members of tzu chi buddhist foundation  the presbyterian church  and followers of the i - kuan tao sect - signed up to share responsibility for the riverside park  which was divided into 90 - meter - long plots for the purpose . \\n turf was laid  flower beds appeared  and the embankment soon became a 1.2 km - long  green great wall .  \\n dreaming by the river \\n  you ca n\\'t go about community work in a standoffish way  and you certainly ca n\\'t operate effectively from behind the scenes - you have to be out there at the front of things . \\n when local people see teachers and doctors coming out to collect trash  they feel encouraged to join in   says E2754 chin - chao  a dentist who chairs the linpien natural history conservation association . \\n E2754 frets about the way the media has focused the spotlight on [him] alone  when numerous other individuals are also involved  all chipping in what they can . \\n  the biggest achievement is that the flowers have n\\'t been stolen   says tsao chi - hung . \\n  as more people volunteer to help  disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely .  \\n the riverside area used to be a teenage hangout  known for its drinking and fighting  but since greenification the town \\'s residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the east  the sunset in the E4817  and the dreamy river alongside the park . \\n  the more that people get involved the greater their sense of accomplishment   says tsao . \\n  it \\'s not just about tidying up the environment . \\n we also hope to foster the commercial interests of the community so as to bring practical benefits for people \\'s lives .  \\n this was the thinking behind tsao \\'s gathering together of various groups for the wax apple festival . \\n according to the archives  400 years ago linpien was a plains - aborigine settlement called  fang - suo - she .  \\n in the middle of the 17th century the ming dynasty loyalist zheng chenggong -lrb- also known as koxinga -rrb- brought an influx of settlers to taiwan from the fujian and guangdong regions of china . \\n some of the fang - suo - she aborigines stayed and intermarried with chinese  while others moved away . \\n the oldest recorded use of the name  linpien  is on a stele  erected in 1762  next to the town \\'s sanshan E6623 E4971 . \\n the name  which means  beside the forest   indicates that the early settlers must have had a tough time clearing land for their crops . \\n moving to center - stage \\n in the past half century or more linpien has concentrated on a series of different forms of produce  from rice  to bananas  to prawn and eel farming  to wax apples - today \\'s main crop . \\n with taiwan \\'s imminent accession to the wto  the next big change could be just around the corner . \\n for example  will wax apples lose their market to imported fruit ? \\n and what does linpien have to offer that other districts in the county ca n\\'t easily duplicate ? \\n yang hung - jen  a phd student at national taiwan university \\'s graduate institute of sociology  came to linpien a year ago to research [his] thesis on the renewal of the local community . \\n  i had come to what was said to be the worst county in taiwan for factionalism and corruption   says yang   a place where the ground had sunk as much as three meters due to subsidence . \\n but the contrast between that image and what i actually found here was quite something .  \\n for yang  the way that those most active in the renewal effort routinely pass the credit to others is itself impressive . \\n linpien rose to prominence on the strength of its celebrated wax apples . \\n but can it now push its way to center - stage as a tourist attraction ? \\n says E2754 chin - chao :  we ca n\\'t yet say how things will turn out for linpien . \\n but that \\'s not to be pessimistic about the town \\'s prospects ; it \\'s simply a case of not building castles in the air .  \\n development of the long - promised tapeng E3618 scenic area is due to begin  and in 2003 the 2nd southern freeway will open . \\n E7366 this bring more prosperity to the area ? \\n construction of a bypass around the town has already boosted property values  but what other benefits may it bring ? \\n a golf course is mooted  but will that mean the loss of birdwatching zones and the mangrove woods ? \\n can the wax apple orchards be adapted to serve as a setting for family outings ? \\n and can fish farms in the locality be converted to provide housing and accommodation  and a recreation alternative for visitors ? \\n can this little town make an asset of its scenic location and historical roots to attract more visitors ? \\n linpien used to be little more than a brief stop for travelers on their way to the seaside resort of kenting  but now its residents are wondering if they can turn the town into a destination in its own right . \\n linpien facts and figures \\n linpien rural township is in pingtung county  located on the pingtung plain at the mouth of the linpien river . \\n it is adjacent to the planned tapeng E3618 scenic area  and marks the point where the 2nd southern freeway will terminate . \\n at 15.6 sq. km in area  it is the second smallest of pingtung county \\'s 33 townships  and has a population of around 23 . \\n wax apples and aquaculture products are the main commodities  with betel nut and coconut also grown . \\n one - third of the township \\'s land is below sea level . \\n visitors are recommended to try the local seafood and also not to miss the opportunity for bird - watching among the nearby estuaries  wetlands and mangrove woods . \\n there are also cultural relics including traces of the original plains - aborigine inhabitants . \\n linpien can be reached along provincial highway 17 . \\n the town has a railway station and can also be accessed by public and private bus services . \\n for more information check out : www.taconet.com.tw/cstudio/ \\n p. 45 \\n using special growing techniques  the farmers of linpien control the quantity of blossoms on the trees so as to optimize the production of their treasured black pearl wax apples . \\n p. 46 \\n aquaculture provides for full nets and full bellies  but it is also the culprit behind linpien \\'s severe subsidence problem . \\n the acreage of fish farms has halved in recent years  due to the combination of falling profits and environmental degradation . \\n p. 47 \\n subsidence has been caused by the over-extraction of ground - water for aquaculture . \\n some of the houses on the linpien - chiatung coastal strip have sunk to the degree that their windows are level with the street and their rooves are within easy reach . \\n p. 48 \\n the gardens of the riverside park  laid out and maintained by local volunteers  cover land that used to be overgrown and strewn with rubbish . \\n the people of the town now come here to stroll and enjoy their free time . \\n p. 48 \\n the river is blessed with fine scenery  and is good for fishing and birdwatching . \\n linpien residents see this as an important asset for attracting tourism . \\n tips for getting through middle age \\n -lrb- E3687 li / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by E4912 E6651 -rrb- \\n middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door . \\n many people peacefully go through it  growing wiser and losing their rough edges . \\n a minority do n\\'t know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap . \\n middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one \\'s life  when one \\'s responsibilities are heaviest . \\n as a result  the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people  so their impact can not be overlooked . \\n middle age  those years between 40 and 60  is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that \\'s easiest to overlook . \\n in comparison to youth or old age  the middle years are often thought of as the time when power  ability  wealth  and physical strength are all at or near their peak  so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy . \\n even if there are problems  it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself  notes chiu chia - li  director of the hwo chyuan pastoral counseling center  who has worked on many middle - aged cases . \\n social bias makes many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems . \\n this is particularly the case for men  who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings . \\n but by keeping everything inside  they may cause irreparable harm to their health . \\n in recent years cancer  sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age  which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked . \\n how do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ? \\n here are a few suggestions : \\n 1. live well at every stage of life \\n li liang - che  a professor of psychology at national chengchi university  looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology . \\n [he] points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood  to youth and middle age . \\n smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier . \\n in other words  the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life . \\n foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble . \\n is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ? \\n chang der - chung  an associate professor in the department of living science at national open university who worked at a counseling hotline for over a decade  argues that any step in the right direction is worthwhile  no matter when you start . \\n middle - aged problems are rather predictable  and they \\'re not hard to avoid . \\n are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ? \\n then no matter how busy you are  you \\'ve got to set aside some time to be with your spouse . \\n are you worried about losing your job ? \\n then start developing a second skill and get into the habit of saving and managing your money . \\n are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ? \\n then spend more time with them  and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves . \\n there are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start . \\n otherwise  you \\'ll end up being overwhelmed . \\n 2. start over \\n in china it used to be said that middle age was the period when one was  heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity .  \\n but now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today \\'s problems . \\n to assume a posture of superiority based on one \\'s seniority will make one despised . \\n hence  it is necessary to cast aside one \\'s old self and start over . \\n chiu notes that many middle - aged who have worked diligently for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for being reckless and disorganized  but they do n\\'t realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath these flaws . \\n stuck in the past and full of bitterness  they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history . \\n with each new era  role models change . \\n until the new role models have been established  it is important to maintain flexibility . \\n for instance  today \\'s middle - aged chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women \\'s liberation movement . \\n they set high expectations for themselves  but their disappointments are likewise large . \\n many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good homemakers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers . \\n their candles are burning at both ends  because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves . \\n then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until they retire . \\n and there are women who are determined to play the role of the traditional chinese wife and mother . \\n ignoring the changing times  they place tremendous pressure on themselves . \\n 3. turn the focus from outside to inside \\n life is a process that moves from the  outward  to the  inward   says E5995 lu  director of the international family life education center  getting to the heart of the matter . \\n lu explains that as children people yearn for the affection of their parents ; as adolescents they want the affirmation of their peers ; and as adults  they set their sights on educational qualifications  finding a good job  making money  marrying a good spouse and so forth . \\n everyone puts the emphasis on outward manifestations of success  and this emphasis on the glitter of outward achievement continues up to middle age . \\n  by middle age  people have gotten from the outside world just about all they can   says lu . \\n  what they have n\\'t attained yet they probably wo n\\'t attain ever  so it \\'s not worth getting all worked up about it . \\n this is the time of life when the doubts set in .  \\n many middle - aged people begin to ask themselves   is this really what i want ? \\n what has been the point of all my hard striving ?  \\n when the doubts come  some people continue trying to find answers from outside  thinking that everything would be fine if they could just change jobs or wives ! \\n but then they rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved in an affair only to find that they \\'ve just made things worse . \\n  in middle age you start to listen to what \\'s going on inside   says lu . \\n  it \\'s the time of life when you start to hone your skills at conversing with your soul .  \\n people ask themselves : am i truly happy ? \\n do i like the person i see in the mirror ? \\n why ? \\n what dreams can i pursue ? \\n at this point  there is no longer any need to try to measure oneself against outside standards . \\n instead it \\'s more important to accept oneself and attempt to find an inner balance . \\n  one need not compare one \\'s inner achievements with those of other people   notes chiu . \\n everyone \\'s circumstances and personalities are different  and they place different expectations on themselves . \\n it \\'s not a matter of being better or worse than anyone else  and there \\'s no need to follow the currents of fashion . \\n everyone is unique . \\n E4411 chang was in [his] fifties when [he] became an entrepreneur and founded taiwan semiconductor . \\n many others at the same time in life have opted to take early retirement and find a guru in india  work as a volunteer  or do whatever else they want to do . \\n in the modern age when people value different things  you can find a purely personal kind of happiness and success . \\n 4. realistically strive for one \\'s dreams \\n when focusing inward  many dreams that have long been discarded will end up floating to the surface . \\n at such times  one should remember to ask oneself three questions : \\n  what do i want ?   what can i do ?  and  what must i do and have ?  \\n chang der - chung reminds people to think clearly about their needs  and then think about the costs . \\n E7366 meeting these personal needs necessarily come into conflict with meeting one \\'s responsibilities ? \\n is there some way that the two can be accomplished simultaneously ? \\n when facing problems at work in taiwan  many people decide to change careers or even to pursue their fortunes in mainland china or southeast E3336 . \\n pursuing some dream of really making it big  many men use up their savings  leaving their wives as the sole source of family support and suffering loneliness in a foreign land . \\n there \\'s no right or wrong here  and there \\'s no way to guarantee a venture will be successful  but beforehand one must at least be realistic and prepare oneself psychologically for all possible outcomes  so that one wo n\\'t suffer losses larger than one can bear . \\n  it is indeed the case that when one is young  one \\'s quiver is full of arrows and opportunities abound  so that one can shoot at will   says chang by way of analogy . \\n  once you get into middle age  you \\'ve got to make every arrow count .  \\n chang explains that everyone has dreams  and that continually working toward those dreams is an excellent method of relieving stress at any age . \\n middle - aged people have heavy burdens  and sometimes they may feel as if they are suffocating under them . \\n  but accomplishing a lot of little changes can bring about a big change .  \\n if you make an effort to do what you can  you will immediately find that your burdens have been lightened . \\n chang cites this example : E5439 you hate being tied up by your work  and would like to go back to school . \\n why do n\\'t you try a weekend class ? \\n maybe that would help to alleviate your anxiety . \\n or if you are a housewife  taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n\\'t go out and get the sense of accomplishment that comes with a full - time job  then maybe you could work as a volunteer in a community organization . \\n this would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment . \\n and you can help to sweat off your middle - aged anxieties by making a habit of regularly exercising . \\n what \\'s more  do n\\'t worry too much about time being short . \\n remember that most modern people live long lives that can be divided up into many stages . \\n in middle age  when you discover that your personal desires are coming into conflict with the demands of your family or society  decide which of your problems are the most urgent . \\n do n\\'t try to accomplish all of your dreams at once . \\n maintain an unhurried frame of mind and peacefully wait for opportunities to present themselves . \\n 5. change your perspective \\n in middle age  one \\'s life is already half over  and one has already amply tasted of life \\'s fruits  both the bitter and the sweet . \\n  i am thankful for the bad times  for they have given me more insight into life and a better opportunity to understand myself   says E7528 hung - kuei  an i - kuan tao devotee  who has studied the book of changes and fengshui . \\n taking care of your parents  losing your job  illness and even being cheated out of money can be embraced as opportunities to experience life . \\n they are lessons that the middle - aged learn from to become more proficient at the art of living . \\n  by changing perspective  you can understand the insignificance of your problems   points out chiu chia - li . \\n it is very important to adjust your frame of mind . \\n you should n\\'t think that there is only one way that you can be . \\n as long as you can accept yourself  then everything is all right . \\n as for losing your job in middle age  some people make nt$ 100 and it \\'s not enough . \\n other\\'s find that nt$ 20 is more than enough to support the family . \\n the problem is that by insisting on making nt$ 100 a month  you may pass by a suitable job that pays nt$ 20 . \\n chang also notes that when people come to forks in the road when they reach middle age  they may look around in all directions and feel at a loss  but they \\'ve got to encourage themselves to keep pressing ahead . \\n  even if you feel uncertain  it should be a positive feeling of uncertainty .  \\n at the very least  you \\'ve got to work hard at establishing a sense of direction . \\n when li liang - che starts feeling sorry for himself  [he] uses the age - old method of considering those who are even worse off . \\n those people who are always complaining about their lot in life should take a walk around a cancer ward   li says . \\n then they \\'ll realize how lucky they are .  \\n chiu chia - li  on the other hand  encourages the middle - aged not to close themselves off . \\n they must get out and make friends  so as to get things off their chests and find support from each other . \\n this makes it easier to get through the bad times . \\n finally  there is something that may seem a little cliched but is often very useful - namely the realization that things will get better  that tomorrow is another day . \\n  whether you are depressed or going berserk  it \\'s important to remember that hormones are raging inside the bodies of the middle - aged   says chang . \\n much like rebellious adolescents  they may merely need to pass through into another stage for the sky to become blue again . \\n do n\\'t give up hope too early  and do n\\'t be afraid of asking for assistance . \\n when you feel at a loss emotionally  the experts will be able to help . \\n p. 18 \\n the shackles of midlife make middle - aged steps heavy . \\n how can one escape from one \\'s commitments to snatch half a day of freedom  and appreciate the world from a new perspective ? \\n p. 20 \\n -lrb- facing page -rrb- \\n the middle - aged have dreams . \\n if built on a solid foundation  they can make life more enjoyable and fulfilling . \\n p. 22 \\n is life getting you down ? \\n go into the crowd  find things to do  and you will rediscover a sense of the value of life . \\n measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room . \\n procter & gamble co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload . \\n the move stems from lessons learned in japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds . \\n it also marks p&g \\'s growing concern that its japanese rivals  such as kao corp.  may bring their superconcentrates to the u.s. . \\n the cincinnati consumer - products giant got clobbered two years ago in japan when kao introduced a powerful detergent  called attack  which quickly won a 30 % stake in the japanese markets . \\n `` they do n\\'t want to get caught again  \\'\\' says one industry watcher . \\n retailers in phoenix  ariz.  say p&g \\'s new powdered detergent -- to be called cheer with color guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early november . \\n a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month . \\n [she] said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others . \\n superconcentrates are n\\'t entirely new for p&g . \\n the company introduced a superconcentrated lemon cheer in japan after watching the success of attack . \\n when attack hit the shelves in 1987  p&g \\'s share of the japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . \\n with the help of lemon cheer  p&g \\'s share is now estimated to be 12 % . \\n while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products  the true test for p&g will be in the $ 4 billion u.s. detergent market  where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders . \\n the company may have chosen to market the product under the cheer name since it \\'s already expanded its best - selling tide into 16 different varieties  including this year \\'s big hit  tide with bleach . \\n with superconcentrates  however  it is n\\'t always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine  believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry . \\n in the early 1980s  p&g tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the E715 brand name that it markets in europe . \\n but the product  which was n\\'t as concentrated as the new cheer  bombed in a market test in denver and was dropped . \\n p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches  but they have n\\'t sold well  despite the convenience . \\n but p&g contends the new cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading . \\n and retailers are expected to embrace the product  in part because it will take up less shelf space . \\n `` when shelf space was cheap  bigger was better  \\'\\' says E3447 zurkuhlen  an analyst at E1184 bros . \\n but with so many brands vying for space  that \\'s no longer the case . \\n if the new cheer sells well  the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates . \\n then retailers `` will probably push the -lcb- less - established -rcb- brands out altogether  \\'\\' [he] says . \\n competition is bound to get tougher if kao introduces a product like attack in the u.s. . \\n to be sure  kao would n\\'t have an easy time taking u.s. market share away from the mighty p&g  which has about 23 % of the market . \\n kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the u.s.  but so far the company has focused on acquisitions  such as last year \\'s purchase of E6464 jergens co.  a cincinnati hand - lotion maker . \\n it also has a product - testing facility in california . \\n some believe p&g \\'s interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the japanese . \\n `` this is something p&g would do with or without kao  \\'\\' says mr. zurkuhlen . \\n with economic tension between the u.s. and japan worsening  many japanese had feared last week \\'s visit from u.s. trade representative E7033 hills . \\n they expected a new barrage of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u.s. . \\n instead  they got a discussion of the need for the u.s. and japan to work together and of the importance of the long - term view . \\n mrs. hills \\' first trip to japan as america \\'s chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month \\'s visit by commerce secretary E3470 a. mosbacher . \\n mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade . \\n [he] said such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents \\'\\' in reducing the u.s. trade deficit with japan . \\n but mrs. hills  speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday  stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer  it is rather to have a blueprint for action . \\'\\' \\n [she] added that [she] expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we \\'re moving in earnest . \\'\\' \\n how such remarks translate into policy wo n\\'t become clear for months . \\n american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills . \\n many called it simply a contrast in styles . \\n but some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . \\n others said the bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand . \\n and some said it reflected the growing debate in E4477 over pursuing free trade with japan versus some kind of managed trade . \\n asked to compare [her] visit to mr. mosbacher \\'s  mrs. hills replied : `` i did n\\'t hear every word [he] spoke  but as a general proposition  i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration . \\'\\' \\n yet more than one american official who sat in with [her] during three days of talks with japanese officials said [her] tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . \\'\\' \\n `` i think my line has been very consistent  \\'\\' mrs. hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon . \\n `` i am painted sometimes as ferocious  perhaps because i have a ferocious list of statutes to implement . \\n i do n\\'t feel very ferocious . \\n i do n\\'t feel either hard or soft . \\n i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . \\'\\' \\n when [she] met the local press for the first time on friday  mrs. hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products  satellites and supercomputers  three areas targeted under the super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill . \\n [she] highlighted exclusionary business practices that the u.s. government has identified . \\n but [her] main thrust was to promote the importance of world - wide free trade and open competition . \\n [she] said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n\\'t be tackled by setting quantitative targets . \\n at [her] news conference for japanese reporters  one economics journalist summed up the japanese sense of relief . \\n `` my impression was that you would be a scary old lady  \\'\\' [he] said  drawing a few nervous chuckles from [his] colleagues . \\n `` but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity . \\'\\' \\n mrs. hills \\' remarks did raise questions  at least among some u.s. officials  about what exactly [her] stance is on u.s. access to the japanese semiconductor market . \\n the u.s. share of the japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years . \\n many americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring u.s. companies a 20 % share by 1991  but the japanese have denied making any such promise . \\n at one of [her] news conferences  mrs. hills said  `` i believe we can do much better than 20 % . \\'\\' \\n but [she] stressed  `` i am against managed trade . \\n i will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market . \\n information international inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized newspaper - publishing system  alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system . \\n a spokesman for information international said the lawsuit by two units of E4411 communications corp. seeks restitution of the system \\'s about $ 3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the E4411 units to information international for alleged failure to pay royalties . \\n information international said it believes that the complaints  filed in federal court in E5705  are without merit . \\n closely held E4411 communications is based in E6827  ga . \\n the units that filed the suit are southeastern newspapers corp. and E6706 publishing co . \\n syms corp. completed the sale of its a. sulka & co. subsidiary  a men \\'s luxury haberdashery  to luxco investments . \\n terms were n\\'t disclosed . \\n as syms \\'s `` core business of off - price retailing grows  a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction  \\'\\' said E5194 syms  president of the parent  in a statement . \\n a spokeswoman said sulka operates a total of seven stores in the u.s. and overseas . \\n syms operates 25 off - price apparel stores in the u.s. . \\n the oil industry \\'s middling profits could persist through the rest of the year . \\n E2390 oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago  largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . \\n the gasoline picture may improve this quarter  but chemicals are likely to remain weak  industry executives and analysts say  reducing chances that profits could equal their year - earlier performance . \\n the industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals  \\'\\' E6690 cox  president of phillips petroleum co.  said in an interview . \\n `` that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings \\'\\' for the industry in general  [he] added . \\n [he] did n\\'t forecast phillips \\'s results . \\n but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies hard - hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third - quarter earnings . \\n so  too  many analysts predict  will exxon corp.  chevron corp. and amoco corp . \\n typical is what happened to the price of ethylene  a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies . \\n it has plunged 13 % since july to around 26 cents a pound . \\n a year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents  peaking at about 34 cents last december . \\n a big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion . \\n beginning in mid-1987  prices began accelerating as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand . \\n companies added capacity furiously . \\n now  greatly increased supplies are on the market  while the dollar is stronger  and domestic economic growth is slower . \\n third - quarter profits from gasoline were weaker . \\n `` refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year  \\'\\' said E3848 randol  a securities analyst at first boston corp . \\n oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and E4684 that did n\\'t materialize . \\n the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . \\n in addition  crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier  further pressuring profitability . \\n refiners say margins picked up in september  and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter  though still not to the level of 1988 \\'s fourth quarter . \\n during the 1988 second half  many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits . \\n crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies \\' earnings this year . \\n prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies \\' expectations . \\n demand has been much stronger than anticipated  and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter . \\n `` we could see higher oil prices this year  \\'\\' said E1584 jacoboski  an analyst at painewebber inc . \\n that will translate into sharply higher production profits  particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter . \\n while oil prices have been better than expected  natural gas prices have been worse . \\n in the third quarter  they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 . \\n the main reason remains weather . \\n last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use . \\n this summer  on the other hand  had milder weather than usual . \\n `` we \\'ve been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices  \\'\\' said mr. cox  phillips \\'s president . \\n `` the lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected . \\'\\' \\n going into the fourth quarter  natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % lower than a year earlier . \\n for instance  natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ 1.47 a thousand cubic feet  down 13 % from $ 1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago . \\n the bush administration  trying to blunt growing demands from western europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the soviet bloc  is questioning whether italy \\'s ing . c. olivetti & co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the soviets . \\n most of the western european members of coordinating committee on multilateral export controls  the unofficial forum through which the u.s. and its allies align their export - control policies  are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in paris oct. 25 and 26 . \\n they plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools  computers and other high - technology products . \\n but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all cocom members are complying fully with existing export - control procedures before it will support further liberalization . \\n to make its point  it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer - driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft . \\n the london sunday times  which first reported the u.s. concerns  cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ 25 million in `` embargoed  state - of - the - art  flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry . \\'\\' \\n olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984 . \\n a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom  but declined to confirm any details . \\n italian president E326 cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke cocom rules . \\n president bush called [his] attention to the matter during the italian leader \\'s visit here last week . \\n olivetti has denied that it violated cocom rules  asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities . \\n although the legality of these sales is still an open question  the disclosure could n\\'t be better timed to support the position of export - control hawks in the pentagon and the intelligence community . \\n `` it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting  \\'\\' said a E4477 lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies . \\n the bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export - control policies  reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies . \\n last summer  mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when [he] told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that [he] would allow some exceptions to the cocom embargo of strategic goods . \\n but more recently  the pentagon and the commerce department openly feuded over the extent to which cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc . \\n however  these agencies generally agree that the E4817 should be cautious about any further liberalization . \\n `` there \\'s no evidence that the soviet program to -lrb- illegally -rrb- acquire western technology has diminished  \\'\\' said a state department spokesman . \\n financial corp. of santa E1194 filed suit against former stock speculator E3647 f. boesky and drexel burnham E6331 inc.  charging they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy $ 284 million in high - yield  high - risk junk bonds . \\n in a suit filed in federal court thursday  the s&l alleged that a `` disproportionate number \\'\\' of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value . \\n financial corp. purchased the bonds  the suit alleged  after mr. boesky and drexel negotiated an agreement for vagabond hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million . \\n vagabond hotels was controlled by mr. boesky  who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations . \\n officials at drexel said they had n\\'t seen the suit and thus could n\\'t comment . \\n in addition to $ 33 million compensatory damages  the suit seeks $ 100 million in punitive damages . \\n also named in the suit is E3647 f. boesky corp. and northview corp.  the successor company to vagabonds hotels . \\n northview officials could n\\'t be located . \\n financial corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of E3647 f. boesky corp. visited it in november 1983 and said financial corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds . \\n shortly before the visit  mr. boesky and drexel representives had met with financial corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51 % stake in the company . \\n however  the agreement was canceled in E2265 1984 . \\n financial corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $ 11 million in losses on them  the company said . \\n ideal basic industries inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for hofi north america inc. to combine its north american cement holdings with ideal in a transaction that will leave ideal \\'s minority shareholders with 12.8 % of the combined company . \\n hofi  the north american holding company of swiss concern holderbank financiere glaris ltd.  previously proposed combining its 100 % stake in st. E2656 cement inc. and its 60 % stake in dundee cement co. with its 67 % stake in ideal . \\n but hofi \\'s first offer would have given ideal \\'s other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company . \\n ideal \\'s directors rejected that offer  although they said they endorsed the merger proposal . \\n under the agreement  hofi will own 87.2 % of the combined company . \\n ideal \\'s current operations will represent about 39.2 % of the combined company . \\n the transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by ideal shareholders . \\n ideal said it expects to complete the transaction early next year . \\n while corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought - induced peaks of 1988  wheat prices remain stubbornly high . \\n and they \\'re likely to stay that way for months to come  analysts say . \\n for one thing  even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last  tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990  the analysts say . \\n and if rain does n\\'t fall soon across many of the great plains \\' wheat - growing areas  yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced  further squeezing supplies . \\n also supporting prices are expectations that the soviet union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months . \\n by next E4615 31  stocks of u.s. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million bushels . \\n that would be the lowest level since the early 1970s . \\n stocks were 698 million bushels on E4615 31 of this year . \\n in response to dwindling domestic supplies  agriculture secretary E5525 yeutter last month said the u.s. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments . \\n the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels . \\n it now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels  compared with this year \\'s estimated 2.04 billion and a drought - stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 . \\n but the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n\\'t be felt until the second half of next year . \\n until then  limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4 - a - bushel level  analysts say . \\n on the chicago board of trade friday  wheat for december delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel  unchanged . \\n in theory at least  tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply - demand squeeze  said E6792 basse  a futures analyst with agresource co. in chicago . \\n such a situation can wreak havoc  as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the chicago board of trade . \\n in july  the cbot ordered ferruzzi finanziaria s.p . a. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans . \\n the exchange said it feared that some members would n\\'t be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the italian conglomerate  which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . \\n ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market . \\n unseasonably hot  dry weather across large portions of the great plains and in wheat - growing areas in E4477 and oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season \\'s winter wheat crop  said E7149 E1495  a futures analyst and head of E1495 analytical in chicago . \\n for example  in the oklahoma panhandle  40 % or more of the topsoil is short of moisture . \\n that figure climbs to about 47 % in wheat - growing portions of kansas  [he] said . \\n the soviet union has n\\'t given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans  but many analysts expect moscow to place sizable orders for u.s. wheat in the next few months  further supporting prices . \\n `` wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of soviet demand \\'\\' in coming weeks  predicted E1976 feltes  vice president  research  for refco inc. in chicago . \\n looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : \\n orange juice traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began friday will go . \\n late thursday  after the close of trading  the market received what would normally have been a bullish u.s. department of agriculture estimate of the 1989 - 90 E6706 orange crop . \\n it was near the low range of estimates  at 130 million 90 - pound boxes  compared with 146.6 million boxes last season . \\n however  as expected  brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 . \\n friday \\'s consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the u.s. report might have had and sent the november orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time . \\n it settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound . \\n brazilian juice  after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season  is beginning to arrive in the u.s. in large quantities . \\n brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product  which is going to be in plentiful supply . \\n the price cut  one analyst said  appeared to be aimed even more at europe  where consumption of brazilian juice has fallen . \\n it \\'s a dollar - priced product  and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in europe  the analyst said . \\n new york futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear . \\n barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas  downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into january  when harvesting and processing of oranges in E6706 reach their peak  the analyst said . \\n energy \\n although some analysts look for profit - taking in the wake of friday \\'s leap in crude oil prices  last week \\'s rally is generally expected to continue this week . \\n `` i would continue to look for a stable crude market  at least in futures \\'\\' trading  said E3848 hinton  an energy futures broker with stotler & co . \\n friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets . \\n on the new york mercantile exchange  E4817 texas intermediate crude for november delivery finished at $ 20.89 a barrel  up 42 cents on the day . \\n on european markets  meanwhile  spot prices of north sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel . \\n `` this market still wants to go higher  \\'\\' said nauman barakat  a first vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc . \\n [he] predicted that the november contract will reach $ 21.50 a barrel or more on the new york mercantile exchange . \\n there has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets . \\n analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes . \\n there also are recurring reports that the soviet union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca n\\'t produce as much as it could sell . \\n many traders foresee a tightening of near - term supplies  particularly of high - quality crudes such as those produced in the north sea and in nigeria . \\n if a hostile predator emerges for saatchi & saatchi co.  co-founders E6289 and E3694 saatchi will lead a management buy - out attempt  an official close to the company said . \\n financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of friday \\'s stock - market sell - off in new york and turmoil in the junk - bond market . \\n but the beleaguered british advertising and consulting giant  which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace E3694 saatchi  has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks . \\n last week  saatchi \\'s largest shareholder  southeastern asset management  said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring . \\n and E2330 spielvogel  chief executive officer of saatchi \\'s big backer spielvogel bates advertising unit  said [he] had offered to lead a management buy - out of the company  but was rebuffed by E6289 saatchi . \\n mr. spielvogel said [he] would n\\'t launch a hostile bid . \\n the executive close to saatchi & saatchi said that `` if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer  a crazy offer which saatchi knew it could n\\'t beat  it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders . \\n but -lcb- otherwise -rcb- it would undoubtedly come back \\'\\' with an offer by management . \\n the executive said any buy - out would be led by the current board  whose chairman is E3694 saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be E6289 saatchi . \\n mr. spielvogel is n\\'t part of the board  nor are any of the other heads of saatchi \\'s big u.s. - based ad agencies . \\n the executive did n\\'t name any price  but securities analysts have said saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion . \\n the executive denied speculation that saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy - back . \\n that speculation abounded friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive  E3470 E3873 - dreyfus  who joins saatchi and becomes a member of its board on jan. 1 . \\n mr. E3873 - dreyfus  formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm ims international inc.  has a reputation as a savvy financial manager  and will be charged largely with repairing saatchi \\'s poor financial state . \\n asked about the speculation that mr. E3873 - dreyfus has been hired to pave the way for a buy - out by the brothers  the executive replied  `` that is n\\'t the reason dreyfus has been brought in . \\n [he] was brought in to turn around the company . \\'\\' \\n separately  several saatchi agency clients said they believe the company \\'s management shakeup will have little affect on them . \\n `` it has n\\'t had any impact on us  nor do we expect it to  \\'\\' said a spokeswoman for miller brewing co.  a major client of backer spielvogel . \\n E719 lampe  director of advertising at painewebber inc.  a saatchi & saatchi advertising client  said : `` we have no problem with the announcement  because we do n\\'t know what change it \\'s going to bring about . \\n we are n\\'t going to change agencies because of a change in london . \\'\\' \\n executives at backer spielvogel client E1932 inc.  as well as at saatchi client philips lighting co.  also said they saw no effect . \\n executives at prudential - bache securities inc.  a backer spielvogel client that is reviewing its account  declined comment . \\n mr. spielvogel had said that prudential - bache was prepared to finance either a management buy -

making capacity . \\n in announcements to workers late last week  gm effectively signed death notices for two full - sized van assembly plants  and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u.s. car factories . \\n gm is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker \\'s u.s. market share skidded during the past decade . \\n the company  currently using about 80 % of its north american vehicle capacity  has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 . \\n just a month ago  gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in lakewood  ga.  the eighth u.s. assembly facility to close since 1987 . \\n now  gm appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s . \\n one reason is mounting competition from new japanese car plants in the u.s. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match . \\n another is that united auto workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no - layoff provisions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year . \\n gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin . \\n the problem  however  is that gm \\'s moves are coming at a time when uaw leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of gm layoffs . \\n against that backdrop  uaw vice president E5466 p. yokich  who recently became head of the union \\'s gm department  issued a statement friday blasting gm \\'s `` flagrant insensitivity \\'\\' toward union members . \\n the auto maker \\'s decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray \\'\\' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information  \\'\\' mr. yokich said . \\n gm officials told workers late last week of the following moves : production of full - sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in E4580  mich . \\n that means two plants -- one in scarborough  ontario  and the other in lordstown  ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 . \\n the shutdowns will idle about 3 canadian assembly workers and about 2 workers in ohio . \\n E3470 white  canadian auto workers union president  used the impending scarborough shutdown to criticize the u.s. - E4944 free trade agreement and its champion  prime minister E5880 mulroney . \\n but canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate gm move that affects three u.s. car plants and one in quebec . \\n workers at plants in E2210 nuys  calif.  oklahoma city and pontiac  mich.  were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the pontiac firebird and chevrolet camaro muscle cars . \\n gm is studying whether it can build the new camaro -

E1210  quebec  company and union officials said . \\n that announcement left union officials in E2210 nuys and oklahoma city uncertain about their futures . \\n the E2210 nuys plant  which employs about 3 workers  does n\\'t have a product to build after 1993 . \\n E242 shrieves  uaw local president  said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant  \\'\\' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . \\n at the oklahoma city plant  which employs about 6 workers building the eight - year - old a - body mid-sized cars  E3626 featherston  uaw local vice president  said the plant has no new product lined up  and `` none of us knows \\'\\' when the a - body cars will die . \\n [he] said [he] believes gm has plans to keep building a - body cars into the mid-1990s . \\n at pontiac  however  the camaro - firebird decision appears to erase uaw hopes that gm would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic - bodied  two - seater pontiac fiero model . \\n the fiero plant was viewed as a model of union - management cooperation at gm before slow sales of the fiero forced the company to close the factory last year . \\n union officials have taken a beating politically as a result . \\n dissident uaw members have used the fiero plant as a symbol of labor - management cooperation \\'s failure . \\n weatherford international inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred - stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock  and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares . \\n the company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585 shares of its preferred stock outstanding . \\n the exchange ratio was never established . \\n weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange . \\n the energy - services concern said  however  that in january 1990  it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . \\n weatherford suspended its preferred - dividend payment in october 1985 and said it has n\\'t any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million  but will do so some time in the future . \\n additionally  the company said it filed with the securities and exchange commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock  expected to be offered in november . \\n the company said E1184 brothers inc. and E3713  weil  labouisse  friedrichs inc.  underwriters for the offering  were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over - allotments . \\n proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt . \\n weatherford currently has approximately 11.1 million common shares outstanding . \\n the bronx has a wonderful botanical garden  a great zoo  its own charming little italy -lrb- on E3538 avenue -rrb- and  of course  the yankees . \\n however  most people  having been subjected to news footage of the devastated south bronx  look at the borough the way E6408 wolfe \\'s E890 mccoy did in `` bonfire of the vanities \\'\\' -- as a wrong turn into hell . \\n but E3687 cunningham \\'s bronx  [her] childhood bronx of the \\'50s  is something else altogether . \\n in a lovely  novelistic memoir  `` sleeping arrangements \\'\\' -lrb- knopf  195 pages  $ 18.95 -rrb-  [she] remembers an exotic playground  peopled mainly by jewish eccentrics and the occasional catholic -lrb- real oddballs like [her] sexpot friend  the hell - kitten E1987  age five -rrb- . \\n ms. cunningham  a novelist and playwright  has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall . \\n [she] transforms [her] `` bronx of the emotions  a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria \\'\\' into the `` babylonian bronx  \\'\\' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue . \\n in the babylonian bronx  jewish working - class people lived in drab  soviet - style buildings `` glamorized \\'\\' with names like anamor towers -lrb- after owners E507 and E4411 snezak -rrb-  whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient syrians and greeks  friezes of pompeii . \\n for ms. cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy [she] felt living in the anamor towers as a little girl : `` ... outwardly ordinary  inwardly ornate  owing all inspiration to heathen cultures . \\'\\' \\n sharp - witted and funny but never mean  [she] \\'s a memorialist a bit like E7018 capote  if [he] \\'d been jewish and female and less bitchy . \\n little E18  as ms. cunningham calls herself in the book  really was n\\'t ordinary . \\n [she] was raised  for the first eight years  by [her] mother  E0  whom [she] remembers as a loving liar  who realigned history to explain why E18 \\'s father did n\\'t live with them . \\n E0 reinvented this man  who may or may not have known about [his] child  as a war hero for E18 \\'s benefit . \\n E0 died young and E18 has remembered [her] as a romantic figure  who did n\\'t interfere much with [her] child \\'s education on the streets . \\n the games bronx children played -lrb- holding kids down and stripping them  for example -rrb- seem tame by today \\'s crack standards  but ms. cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure . \\n `` without official knowledge of sex or death  we flirted with both  \\'\\' [she] writes . \\n [she] analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements . \\n [her] friend E4802  whose parents kept reminding [her] [she] was unwanted  slept on a narrow bed wedged into [her] parents \\' bedroom  as though [she] were a temporary visitor . \\n [her] friend E1987 \\'s father was a professional thief ; they did n\\'t seem to have any bedrooms at all . \\n maybe E18 became so obsessed with where people slept and how because [her] own arrangements kept shifting . \\n when E0 died  [her] uncles moved in -- and let [her] make the sleeping and other household arrangements . \\n they painted the apartment orange  pink and white  according to [her] instructions . \\n with loving detail [she] recalls [her] uncle E2503  an orthodox jew and song lyricist -lrb- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -rrb- ; and uncle E573  a mysterious part - time investigator who looked like E6323 and carried a change of clothing in a manila envelope  like an `` undercover president on a good - will mission . \\'\\' \\n they came by their strangeness honestly . \\n E18 \\'s grandmother  no cookie baker  excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album  and lugged around [her] perennial work - in - progress  `` philosophy for women . \\'\\' \\n the book loses some momentum toward the end  when E18 becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with [her] delightfully weird family . \\n for the most part  though  there \\'s much pleasure in [her] saucy  poignant probe into the mysteries of the babylonian bronx . \\n the bronx also figures in E5961 E7165 friedman \\'s latest novel  which flashes back to the new york of the \\'50s . \\n but both the past and present worlds of `` the current climate \\'\\' -lrb- atlantic monthly press  200 pages  $ 18.95 -rrb- feel cramped and static . \\n for [his] sixth novel  mr. friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of [his] 1972 work  `` about E3107 towns . \\'\\' \\n E3107 is now a 57 - year - old writer  whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in hollywood and new york seems quaintly out - of - synch . \\n E3107 fondly remembers the `` old \\'\\' days of the early \\'70s  when people like [his] friend E6608 would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what E6608 was doing wrong . \\n `` an l.a. solution  \\'\\' explains mr. friedman . \\n line by line mr. friedman \\'s weary cynicism can be amusing  especially when [he] \\'s riffing on the hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up  immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it . \\n E3107 has avoided all that by living in a long island suburb with [his] wife  who \\'s so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels [she] barely seems to notice when [her] husband disappears for drug - seeking forays into manhattan . \\n but it does n\\'t take too many lines to figure E3107 out . \\n [he] \\'s a bore . \\n gulf resources & chemical corp. said it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the environmental protection agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in idaho . \\n in 1984 the epa notified gulf resources  which was a part - owner of the smelter  that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal superfund program . \\n the 21 - square - mile area is contaminated with lead  zinc and other metals . \\n gulf resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a bermuda concern  potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter \\'s cleanup costs . \\n the company said that as part of its agreement with the epa  it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization . \\'\\' \\n the company  which issued a statement on the agreement late friday  said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500 will be recognized in its 1989 third - quarter statement . \\n the agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval  the company said . \\n gulf resources added that it `` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the superfund law . \\'\\' \\n under the agreement  gulf must give the u.s. government 45 days \\' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock . \\n the company \\'s net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the dividends are issued . \\n `` the terms of that agreement only become effective the date of gulf \\'s reorganization  which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990  \\'\\' said E2656 r. mehl  gulf \\'s general counsel . \\n in addition  gulf must give the government 20 days \\' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ 50 million that are made to the bermuda - based holding company . \\n gulf \\'s net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million . \\n separately  the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization . \\n the real estate slump that \\'s pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city \\'s retail real estate market . \\n in manhattan  once - desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill . \\n retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy  turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom . \\n `` there is an unbelievable amount of space available  \\'\\' says E6925 consolo  senior vice president at garrick - aug associates store leasing inc . \\n there are about 2 stores for rent  up from a more typical range of 1 to 1 . \\n `` this further confuses retailers  \\'\\' [she] says . \\n `` they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? \\n is this the wrong time to open a store ? \\n who is going to be in the space next door ? \\'\\' \\n in addition  ms. consolo says  tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one - quarter lower than landlords \\' initial asking price . \\n a handful of hot retail locations  such as the 57th street and E7356 and fifth avenue areas  have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents . \\n and  in some neighborhoods  rents have merely hit a plateau . \\n but on average  manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone  experts say . \\n that follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months  after manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 . \\n the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing . \\n `` as businesses contract or depart  the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks  \\'\\' says E4265 a. friedman  senior vice president of helmsley spear inc . \\n [he] says financial problems plaguing electronics  fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market . \\n hardest hit are what [he] calls `` secondary \\'\\' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents . \\n in these locations  mr. friedman says  `` retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . \\'\\' \\n weakness in the restaurant industry  which is leaving retail space vacant  exacerbates the problem for landlords . \\n it is also no comfort to landlords and small new york retailers when the future of larger department stores  which anchor retail neighborhoods  are in doubt . \\n hooker corp.  parent of bonwit teller and b. altman \\'s  is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and bloomingdale \\'s is for sale by its owner  campeau corp . \\n the trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in new york are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents . \\n but  despite the recent softening  for many of these retailers there \\'s still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s  when their leases were signed . \\n certainly  the recent drop in prices does n\\'t mean manhattan comes cheap . \\n new york retail rents still run well above the going rate in other u.s. cities . \\n E7356 and fifth avenues and east 57th street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot  and $ 250 is not uncommon . \\n the thriving 34th street area offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot  as do up - and - coming locations along lower fifth avenue . \\n by contrast  rentals in the best retail locations in boston  san E960 and chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot . \\n and rents on E5416 hills \\' rodeo drive generally do n\\'t exceed about $ 125 a square foot . \\n the new york stock exchange said two securities will begin trading this week . \\n precision castparts corp.  portland  ore.  will begin trading with the symbol pcp . \\n it makes investment castings and has traded over - the - counter . \\n E5721 bank of scotland group plc  an edinburgh  scotland  financial services company  will list american depositary shares  representing preferred shares  with the symbol rbspr . \\n it will continue to trade on the international stock exchange  london . \\n the american stock exchange listed shares of two companies . \\n aim telephones inc.  a parsippany  n.j.  telecommunications equipment supply company  started trading with the symbol aim . \\n it had traded over -

the - counter market listed shares of one company . \\n employee benefit plans inc.  a minneapolis health - care services company  was listed with the symbol ebpi . \\n when justice E3848 brennan marks the start of [his] 34th year on the supreme court today  the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of [his] tenure . \\n for the first time  the 83 - year - old justice finds [his] influence almost exclusively in dissent  rather than as a force in the high court \\'s majority . \\n this role reversal holds true  as well  for [his] three liberal and moderate allies  justices thurgood E4229  E3107 blackmun and E719 stevens . \\n but are these four players  three of them in their 80s  ready to assume a different role after 88 years  collectively  of service on the high court ? \\n every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role  and the frustrations that go with it  but in different ways . \\n justices brennan and stevens appear philosophical about it ; justices E4229 and blackmun appear fighting mad . \\n the four justices are no newcomers to dissent  often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court \\'s conservative drift . \\n but always  in years past  they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases . \\n now  however  as the court \\'s new five - member conservative majority continues to solidify  victories for the liberals are rare . \\n the change is most dramatic for justice brennan  the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under chief justice E4861 E6366 . \\n in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967  the height of the E6366 court \\'s power  justice brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court . \\n last term alone [he] cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions  with the contentious flag - burning ruling as [his] only big victory . \\n but justice brennan foresaw [his] new role  strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech . \\n `` each time the court revisits an issue  the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result  \\'\\' [he] said . \\n moreover  in recent months [he] has said that when [he] was on the winning side in the 1960s  [he] knew that the tables might turn in the future . \\n [he] has said that [he] now knows how justice E719 E1104 felt  a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the E6366 court \\'s opinions . \\n associates of 81 - year - old justice E4229 say [he] was `` depressed \\'\\' about the court \\'s direction last spring  but is feisty about [his] role and determined to speak out against the court \\'s cutbacks in civil rights . \\n `` we could sweep it under the rug and hide it  but i \\'m not going to do it  \\'\\' [he] said in a speech last month . \\n [he]  like justice brennan  considers dissents highly important for the future  a point that has n\\'t escaped legal scholars . \\n E5835 law school professor E5644 tribe says there is a `` generation - skipping \\'\\' flavor to current dissents . \\n the dissenters in the E6366 court  [he] says  appeared to be writing for the short - term  suggesting that the court \\'s direction might change soon . \\n `` brennan and E4229 are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future  \\'\\' [he] says . \\n justice blackmun  who will turn 81 next month  also seems feisty about [his] new role . \\n associates say [he] takes some defeats more personally than [his] colleagues  especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in [his] 1973 opinion  roe vs. E7471 . \\n friends and associates who saw justice blackmun during the summer said [he] was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years . \\n and [his] outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in E4684 . \\n but [his] level of frustration showed in a recent  impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago . \\n [he] concluded [his] remarks by quoting  emotionally and at some length  according to those present  the late E6843 E4603 E6623 \\'s famous `` i have a dream \\'\\' speech from the 1963 march on E4477 . \\n justice stevens  69  is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about [his] role  in part because [he] may be the least liberal of the four  but also because [he] enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others . \\n if the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history  it also differs in an important way from recent history  court watchers say . \\n `` the dissenters of the E6366 court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited  \\'\\' says prof. a.e. E6661 E3713 of the university of E3957 law school  `` but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created . \\n the government sold the deposits of four savings - and - loan institutions  in its first wave of sales of big  sick thrifts  but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth . \\n the four s&ls were sold to large banks  as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago . \\n two of the four big thrifts were sold to ncnb corp.  E4853  n.c.  which has aggressively expanded its markets  particularly in texas and E6706 . \\n a canadian bank bought another thrift  in the first rtc transaction with a foreign bank . \\n under these deals  the rtc sells just the deposits and the healthy assets . \\n these `` clean - bank \\'\\' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets  mostly real estate  with the government  to be sold later . \\n in these four  for instance  the rtc is stuck with $ 4.51 billion in bad assets . \\n acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % for the deposits and branch systems  roughly in line with what analysts were expecting . \\n the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks  as has been the case with previous deals . \\n after that  the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts . \\n but it \\'s uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps . \\n ncnb  for example  has been one of the highest rate payers in the texas market  and in E6706  rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities . \\n the rtc had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines  but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency . \\n `` these thrifts are beached whales  \\'\\' said E2171 E2110  an industry consultant based in alexandria  va . \\n for example  the delay in selling people \\'s heritage savings  salina  kan.  with $ 1.7 billion in assets  has forced the rtc to consider selling off the thrift branch - by - branch  instead of as a whole institution . \\n ncnb continued its foray into the E6706 and texas markets . \\n ncnb will acquire university federal savings association  houston  which had assets of $ 2.8 billion . \\n ncnb texas national bank will pay the rtc a premium of $ 129 million for $ 3.5 billion in deposits . \\n as a measure of the depths to which the texas real estate market has sunk  the rtc will pay $ 3.8 billion to ncnb to take $ 750 million of bad assets . \\n ncnb also acquired freedom savings & loan association  tampa  fla.  which had total assets of $ 900 million . \\n ncnb will pay the rtc a premium of $ 40.4 million for $ 1.1 billion in deposits . \\n ncnb will also acquire $ 266 million of freedom \\'s assets from the rtc  which will require $ 875 million in assistance . \\n meridian bancorp inc.  reading  pa.  will acquire E5331 financial savings association  E3996 E5331  pa.  which had $ 2.3 billion in assets . \\n meridian will pay a premium of $ 30.5 million to assume $ 2 billion in deposits . \\n it will also purchase $ 845 million of the thrift \\'s assets  with $ 1.9 billion in rtc assistance . \\n in the first rtc transaction with a foreign buyer  E5721 trustco ltd.  toronto  will acquire pacific savings bank  E4290 mesa  calif.  which had $ 949 million in assets . \\n E5721 trustco will pay the rtc $ 25 million to assume $ 989 million in deposits . \\n it will also purchase $ 473 million in assets  and receive $ 550 million in assistance from the rtc . \\n the following issues were recently filed with the securities and exchange commission : \\n american cyanamid co.  offering of 1 common shares  via E5049 lynch capital markets . \\n limited inc.  offering of up to $ 300 million of debt securities and warrants . \\n nuveen california performance plus municipal fund inc.  initial offering of five million common shares  via E3259 . brown & sons inc.

E5344 dodd called the state department for a briefing . \\n `` they said  ` follow cnn  \\' \\'\\' [he] told reporters . \\n that shows how far E2208 E346 \\'s cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago  when it was considered the laughingstock of television news . \\n it is bigger  faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks . \\n its niche as the `` network of record \\'\\' during major crises draws elite audiences around the world . \\n but for all its success  cnn has hit a plateau . \\n although viewership soars when big news breaks  it ebbs during periods of calm . \\n cnn executives worry that the network \\'s punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n\\'t keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable - tv . \\n `` just the fact we \\'re on 24 hours is no longer bulletin  \\'\\' says E6166 E346  cnn \\'s executive vice president  news gathering -lrb- and no relation to E2208 E346 -rrb- . \\n `` you ca n\\'t live on that . \\'\\' \\n so cnn  a unit of E4056 - based E346 broadcasting system inc.  is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel  or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind \\'\\' network . \\n tonight  to kick off the effort  cnn will premiere its first prime - time newscast in years  an hourlong show at 6 p.m . eastern time to air head - to - head against the network newscasts . \\n the show will be co-anchored by E596 E5568 and E7179 crier  a 34 - year - old former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism . \\n the new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full - length `` signature \\'\\' programming with recognizable stars . \\n to distinguish itself  cnn is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global - news program . \\n it is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers . \\n and it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative - reporting team . \\n `` the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables  \\'\\' says E574 petrovich  executive vice president of headline news  cnn \\'s sister network . \\n but that wo n\\'t be easy . \\n networks  like other consumer products  develop images in peoples \\' minds that are n\\'t easy to change . \\n it also takes money that cnn has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see . \\n and the cable - tv operators -- cnn \\'s distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are . \\n the repositioning bid is aimed at cnn \\'s unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable - tv news market grows more competitive . \\n already  cnn is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. \\'s consumer news and business channel  both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future . \\n in addition  many cable - tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations . \\n cnn wants to change its viewers \\' habits . \\n its watchers are  on the whole  a disloyal group of channel - zapping `` grazers \\'\\' and news junkies  who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching cnn  according to audience research . \\n that \\'s less than one - third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks . \\n the brief attention viewers give cnn could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data  and advertising  become more important to cable - tv channels . \\n cnn \\'s viewer habits have been molded by its format . \\n its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service . \\n it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world  so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks . \\n it filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` daybreak  \\'\\' `` daywatch  \\'\\' `` newsday  \\'\\' and `` newsnight  \\'\\' but the shows varied little in content  personality or look . \\n now  the push is on for more - distinctive shows . \\n `` our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity  \\'\\' says E2138 E3791  cnn executive vice president for programming . \\n accordingly  cnn is adding a world - affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global - news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated \\'\\' programs in viewers \\' minds  says mr. E3791 . \\n and it is exploring other original programs  similar to its `` E642 E6623 live \\'\\' and `` crossfire \\'\\' talk shows  which executives hope will keep people tuned in . \\n then there \\'s `` the world today  \\'\\' the prime - time newscast featuring mr. E5568 and ms. crier . \\n until now  cnn has featured its hollywood gossip show during the key evening period . \\n but 70 % of the cable - television - equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m.  the network discovered  so cnn wants in . \\n mr. E3791 says the E5568 - crier team will probably do two live interviews a day  with most of the program  at least for now  appearing similar to cnn \\'s other newcasts . \\n some in the industry are skeptical . \\n `` i find it hard to conceive of people switching over to cnn for what  at least in the public \\'s mind  is the same news  \\'\\' says E2863 E2204  the former two - time president of nbc news and creator of the E2676 - E3931 report . \\n the evening news is also slated as cnn \\'s stage for its big push into investigative journalism . \\n in E4684  the network hired award - winning producer E3012 E5331  the former head of news specials at abc . \\n [she] \\'s assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly  in - depth segments  with an eye toward breaking big stories . \\n cnn executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded \\'\\' programs  in the way `` 60 minutes \\'\\' did so well for cbs . \\n that \\'s such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical cnn will follow through with its investigative commitment  especially after it sees the cost of producing in - depth pieces . \\n `` they \\'ve never shown any inclination to spend money on production  \\'\\' says E5324 mosettig  a senior producer with macneil - lehrer newshour  who notes that cnn is indispensable to [his] job . \\n the network \\'s salaries have always ranged far below industry standards  resulting in a less - experienced work force . \\n cnn recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 %  but they \\'re still drastically underpaid compared with the networks . \\n says mr. mosettig : `` cnn is my wire service ; they \\'re on top of everything . \\n but to improve  they \\'ve really got to make the investment in people . \\'\\' \\n in any case  cable - tv - system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with cnn \\'s format . \\n they market cable - tv on the very grazing opportunities cnn seeks to discourage . \\n `` we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general - interest  long - format programming  \\'\\' says E3470 stengel  senior vice president  programming  of continental cablevision inc.  which holds a 2 % stake in E346 broadcasting . \\n the second u.s. circuit court of appeals opinion in the arcadian phosphate case did not repudiate the position pennzoil co. took in its dispute with texaco  contrary to your sept. 8 article `` court backs texaco \\'s view in pennzoil E6673 -- too late . \\'\\' \\n the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound . \\n in the pennzoil / texaco litigation  the courts found pennzoil and getty oil intended to be bound ; in arcadian phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound . \\n admittedly  the principle in the cases is the same . \\n but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts . \\n and the facts  as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits  were different . \\n when you suggest otherwise  you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation . \\n E6289 f. vihon \\n valley federal savings & loan association said imperial corp. of america withdrew from regulators its application to buy five valley federal branches  leaving the transaction in limbo . \\n the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial corp.  whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal office of thrift supervision because of an informal notice that imperial \\'s thrift unit failed to meet community reinvestment act requirements . \\n the community reinvestment act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received . \\n the transaction  announced in E4684  included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in california \\'s san E1997 valley . \\n terms were n\\'t disclosed  but valley federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually . \\n valley federal said friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with imperial corp.  which said it is attempting to meet community reinvestment act requirements . \\n valley federal  with assets of $ 3.3 billion  is based in E2210 nuys . \\n imperial corp.  based in san E933  is the parent of imperial savings & loan . \\n in the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ 33.1 million . \\n call it the `` we \\'re too broke to fight \\'\\' defense . \\n lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers  developers and creditors . \\n the thrifts \\' lawyers claim that the suits  numbering 700 to 1 in texas alone  should be dismissed as moot because neither the s&ls nor the extinct federal savings and loan insurance corp. has the money to pay judgments . \\n though the argument may have a common - sense ring to it  even the s&l lawyers concede there \\'s little precedent to back their position . \\n still  one federal appeals court has signaled it \\'s willing to entertain the notion  and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law . \\n the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in texas and reducing the fslic \\'s massive legal bills  which topped $ 73 million last year . \\n the s&l lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate - court ruling in two cases brought against defunct sunbelt savings & loan association of E5795 by the developers of the valley ranch  best known as the training center for the E5795 cowboys football team . \\n sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch . \\n sunbelt and the fslic argued to the fifth u.s. circuit court of appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against sunbelt savings nor any means to collect from any other party  including fslic . \\'\\' \\n `` if true  \\'\\' the court wrote  `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds . \\'\\' \\n but the court said it lacked enough financial information about sunbelt and the fslic and sent the cases back to federal district court in E5795 . \\n E6289 haworth  a lawyer for sunbelt  says [he] plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits  because sunbelt \\'s liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ 2 billion when federal regulators closed it in E4684 1988 . \\n `` this institution is just brain dead  \\'\\' says mr. haworth  a partner in the E5795 office of andrews & kurth  a houston law firm . \\n but a lawyer for triland investment group  the developer of valley ranch  dismisses such arguments as a `` defense du jour . \\'\\' \\n attorney E1976 E5548 of E5795 says a judgment for triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award  including the reversal of sunbelt \\'s foreclosure on valley ranch . \\n `` we \\'re asking the court for a number of things [he] can grant in addition to the thrill of victory  \\'\\' [he] says . \\n `` we \\'d take the valley ranch free and clear as a booby prize . \\n E281 j. thygerson  who was named president of this thrift holding company in E4684  resigned  citing personal reasons . \\n mr. thygerson said [he] had planned to travel between the job in denver and [his] san E933 home  but has found the commute too difficult to continue . \\n a new president was n\\'t named . \\n south africa freed the anc \\'s sisulu and seven other political prisoners . \\n thousands of supporters  many brandishing flags of the outlawed african national congress  gave the anti-apartheid activists a tumultuous reception upon their return to black townships across the country . \\n most of those freed had spent at least 25 years in prison . \\n the 77 -

point drop in the dow jones industrial average  analysts said it did play a role in the market \\'s decline . \\n analysts immediately viewed the price data  the grimmest inflation news in months  as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . \\n further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit  the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in september  to $ 145.21 billion . \\n that rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in E4684  and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . \\n `` i think the friday report  combined with the actions of the fed  weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy  \\'\\' said E3470 dederick  chief economist at northern trust co. in chicago . \\n but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers . \\n `` the overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself  but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy  the producer price index still increased by 0.7 %  \\'\\' said E351 richards  an economist at the national association of manufacturers . \\n but sung won sohn  chief economist at norwest corp. in minneapolis  blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump . \\n `` i would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip  \\'\\' [he] said . \\n `` the core rate is not really out of line . \\'\\' \\n all year  energy prices have skewed the producer price index  which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods . \\n inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter  when a steep run - up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double - digit annual rates . \\n energy prices then plummeted through the summer  causing the index to decline for three consecutive months . \\n overall  the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year  the labor department said . \\n while far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year  that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 . \\n moreover  this year \\'s good inflation news may have ended last month  when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in E4684 . \\n some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead  leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . \\n analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index  but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated . \\n `` i think the resurgence -lcb- in inflation -rcb- is going to continue for a few months  \\'\\' said E719 mueller  chief economist at E4869 mueller cannon  a E4477 economic forecasting firm . \\n [he] predicted that inflation will moderate next year  saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world - wide . \\n but E3375 E2210 dongen  president of the national association of wholesaler - distributors  said that last month \\'s rise `` is n\\'t as bad an omen \\'\\' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . \\n `` if you examine the data carefully  the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices  rather than being a broad - based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods  \\'\\' [he] explained . \\n passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in september  after climbing 0.5 % in E4684 and declining in the late spring and summer . \\n many analysts said the september increase was a one - time event  coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models . \\n although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations  car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase . \\n prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in september  while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % . \\n food prices declined 0.6 %  after climbing 0.3 % in E4684 . \\n meanwhile  the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in september to $ 32.82 billion . \\n but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices  analysts said . \\n sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7 % after declining 0.6 % in E4684  while sales of building materials fell 1.8 % after rising 1.7 % . \\n producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4 % in september  after dropping for three consecutive months . \\n prices for crude goods  an array of raw materials  jumped 1.1 % after declining 1.9 % in E4684 and edging up 0.2 % in july . \\n here are the labor department \\'s producer price indexes -lrb- 1982 = 100 -rrb- for september  before seasonal adjustment  and the percentage changes from september  1988 . \\n on a recent saturday night  in the midst of E4817 germany \\'s most popular prime - time show  a contestant bet the host that [she] could name any of 100 different cheeses after just one nibble  while blindfolded . \\n the woman won the bet . \\n but perhaps even more remarkable  the three - hour - show  `` wetten dass \\'\\' -lrb- make a bet -rrb-  regularly wins the top slot in the country \\'s tv ratings  sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of E4817 german households . \\n as the 1992 economic integration approaches  europe \\'s cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against american `` cultural imperialism  \\'\\' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` E5795  \\'\\' `` miami vice \\'\\' and `` l.a. law . \\'\\' \\n but much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out . \\n the most militant opposition to american tv imports has come from E4077 television and movie producers  who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of europe \\'s tv shows be produced in europe . \\n so far  the E4077 have failed to win enough broad - based support to prevail . \\n a glance through the television listings and a few twists of the european television dial suggest one reason why . \\n while there are some popular action and drama series  few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect . \\n more european air time is filled with low - budget game shows  variety hours  movies and talk shows  many of which are authorized knock - offs of their american counterparts . \\n one of E2648 \\'s most popular saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar - school classmates for on - air reunions . \\n a flemish game show has as its host a belgian pretending to be italian . \\n one of italy \\'s favorite shows  `` fantastico  \\'\\' a tepid variety show  is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product  `` cacao fantastico  \\'\\' whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product did n\\'t exist . \\n topping the cheese stunt  on another typical evening of fun on `` wetten dass  \\'\\' a contestant won a bet with the show \\'s host  E3778 gottschalk  that [he] could identify 300 german dialects over the telephone . \\n a celebrity guest  u.s. ambassador to E4817 germany E1976 E4284  also won a bet that someone could pile up $ 150 worth of quarters on a slanted coin . \\n mr. E4284 nonetheless paid the penalty as if [he] had lost  agreeing to spend a day with E4817 german foreign minister E3731 - E264 genscher frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes . \\n if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers  it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get . \\n european programs usually target only their own local audience  and often only a small portion of that . \\n mega-hits in germany or italy rarely make it even to E2648 or great britain  and almost never show up on u.s. screens . \\n attempts to produce `` pan-european \\'\\' programs have generally resulted in disappointment . \\n one annual co-production  the three - hour - long `` eurovision song contest  \\'\\' featuring soft - rock songs from each of 20 european countries  has been described as the world \\'s most boring tv show . \\n another  `` jeux sans frontieres  \\'\\' where villagers from assorted european countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks  is a hit in E2648 . \\n a u.s. - made imitation under the title `` almost anything goes \\'\\' flopped fast . \\n for the most part  what \\'s made here stays here  and for good reason . \\n the cream of the british crop  the literary dramas that are shown on u.s. public television as `` masterpiece theater  \\'\\' make up a relatively small part of british air time . \\n most british programming is more of an acquired taste . \\n there is  for instance  `` one man and [his] dog  \\'\\' a herding contest among sheep dogs . \\n also riveting to the british are hours of dart - throwing championships  even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons . \\n european drama has had better  though still mixed  fortunes . \\n the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns . \\n a E4077 knock - off of `` E5795  \\'\\' called `` chateauvallon \\'\\' and set in a E4077 vineyard  had a good run in E2648  which ended after the female lead was injured in a real - life auto accident . \\n `` schwarzwaldklinik  \\'\\' -lrb- black E3210 clinic -rrb-  a kind of german `` st . elsewhere \\'\\' set in a health spa  is popular in germany  and has spread into E2648 . \\n italy \\'s most popular series is a drama called `` E5418 piovra  \\'\\' or `` the octopus  \\'\\' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in palermo against the mafia . \\n it was front - page news in italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series . \\n spain \\'s most popular mini-series this year was `` juncal  \\'\\' the story of an aging bullfighter . \\n `` the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular  with american programs second  \\'\\' says E5880 wenham  a former director of programs for the british broadcasting corp . \\n `` given a choice  everybody will watch a home - produced show . \\'\\' \\n but frequently there is n\\'t much choice . \\n thus  europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own  programs with broader appeal . \\n `` we \\'ve basically got to start from scratch  to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see  \\'\\' concedes E1364 young  head of britain \\'s national film theatre school . \\n while some in the u.s. contend that advertising is the bane of television  here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry \\'s sluggish development . \\n until recently  national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising . \\n since production costs were guaranteed  it did n\\'t matter that a program could n\\'t be sold abroad or put into syndication  as most american programs are . \\n but not much money was spent on the shows  either  a situation that encouraged cheap - to - make talk and game shows  while discouraging expensive - to - produce dramas . \\n now  however  commercial channels are coming to most european countries  and at the same time  satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . \\n just last week  greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels . \\n the result is a new and huge appetite for programming . \\n but perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas  most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the u.s. . \\n E5247 channel  a british -

missile divisions  greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors . \\n the 50 - 50 joint venture  which may be dubbed eurodynamics  would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 2.17 billion -rrb- and would be among the world \\'s largest missile makers . \\n after two years of talks  plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek E4077 and british government clearance . \\n the companies hope for a final agreement by year - end . \\n the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies  and help make them a leading force in european defense contracting . \\n in recent months  a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once - balkanized world of european arms manufacture . \\n already  british aerospace and E4077 government - controlled thomson - csf collaborate on a british missile contract and on an air - traffic control radar system . \\n just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy ferranti international signal plc  a smaller british defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a u.s. unit . \\n the sudden romance of british aerospace and thomson - csf -- traditionally bitter competitors for middle east and third world weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in western europe \\'s defense industry . \\n most threatened by closer british aerospace - thomson ties would be their respective national rivals  including matra s.a. in E2648 and britain \\'s general electric co. plc . \\n but neither matra nor gec -- unrelated to stamford  conn. - based general electric co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces . \\n yesterday  a source close to gec confirmed that [his] company may join the ferranti fight  as part of a possible consortium that would bid against british aerospace and thomson - csf . \\n companies with which gec has had talks about a possible joint ferranti bid include matra  britain \\'s dowty group plc  E4817 germany \\'s daimler - benz ag  and E2648 \\'s dassault group . \\n but it may be weeks before gec and its potential partners decide whether to bid  the source indicated . \\n gec plans first to study ferranti \\'s financial accounts  which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a u.s. unit  international signal & control group  with which ferranti merged last year . \\n also  any gec bid might be blocked by british antitrust regulators ; ferranti is gec \\'s main competitor on several key defense - electronics contracts  and its purchase by gec may heighten british defense ministry worries about concentration in the country \\'s defense industry . \\n a consortium bid  however  would diminish gec \\'s direct role in ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials . \\n a british aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with gec for ferranti : `` competition is the name of the game  \\'\\' [she] said . \\n at least one potential gec partner  matra  insists it is n\\'t interested in ferranti . \\n `` we have nothing to say about this affair  which does n\\'t concern us  \\'\\' a matra official said sunday . \\n the missile venture  the british aerospace spokeswoman said  is a needed response to the `` new environment \\'\\' in defense contracting . \\n for both thomson and british aerospace  earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries ; and middle east sales  a traditional mainstay for both companies \\' exports  have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . \\n the venture \\'s importance for thomson is great . \\n thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans . \\n the european defense industry is consolidating ; for instance  E4817 germany \\'s siemens ag recently joined gec in a takeover of britain \\'s plessey co.  and daimler - benz agreed to buy messerschmitt - boelkow blohm g.m.b . h . \\n in missiles  thomson is already overshadowed by british aerospace and by its home rival  E2648 \\'s aerospatiale s.a. ; to better compete  thomson officials say  they need a partnership . \\n to justify 50 - 50 ownership of the planned venture  thomson would make a cash payment to british aerospace . \\n annual revenue of british aerospace \\'s missile business is about # 950 million  a thomson spokesman said . \\n british aerospace \\'s chief missile products include its 17 - year - old family of rapier surface - to - air missiles . \\n thomson missile products  with about half british aerospace \\'s annual revenue  include the crotale surface - to - air missile family . \\n interprovincial pipe line co. said it will delay a proposed two - step  830 million canadian - dollar -lrb- us$ 705.6 million -rrb- expansion of its system because E4944 \\'s output of crude oil is shrinking . \\n interprovincial  E4944 \\'s biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the u.s.  said revised industry forecasts indicate that canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991  8 % lower than a previous estimate . \\n canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 \\'s first half  about 1 % below the 1988 level . \\n `` the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping  \\'\\' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically  as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas  said E1305 watkins  vice president for government and industry relations with interprovincial \\'s parent  interhome energy inc . \\n mr. watkins said volume on interprovincial \\'s system is down about 2 % since january and is expected to fall further  making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . \\n `` there has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side  \\'\\' [he] said . \\n many of E4944 \\'s oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil  and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . \\n the number of active drilling rigs in E4944 is down 30 % from a year ago  and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that  due to the increasing focus on gas exploration  \\'\\' said E3470 feick  manager of crude oil with calgary \\'s independent petroleum association of E4944  an industry group . \\n mr. watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature  conventional fields in western E4944 . \\n interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western E4944  and almost 60 % of interprovincial \\'s total volume consists of light crude . \\n nearly all of the crude oil that E4944 exports to the u.s. is transported on interprovincial \\'s system  whose main line runs from edmonton to major u.s. and canadian cities in the great lakes region  including chicago  buffalo  toronto and montreal . \\n E4944 \\'s current oil exports to the u.s. total about 600 barrels a day  or about 9.1 % of net u.s. crude imports  said E719 lichtblau  president of the new york - based petroleum industry research foundation . \\n that ranks E4944 as the fourth - largest source of imported crude  behind saudi arabia  nigeria and mexico . \\n mr. lichtblau said E4944 \\'s declining crude output  combined with the fast - shrinking output of u.s. crude  will help intensify u.s. reliance on oil from overseas  particularly the middle east . \\n `` it \\'s very much a growing concern . \\n but when something is inevitable  you learn to live with it  \\'\\' [he] said . \\n mr. lichtblau stressed that the delay of interprovincial \\'s proposed expansion wo n\\'t by itself increase u.s. dependence on offshore crude  however  since canadian imports are limited in any case by E4944 \\'s falling output . \\n under terms of its proposed two - step expansion  which would have required regulatory approval  interprovincial intended to add 200 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system  beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 . \\n the system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day . \\n population drain ends for midwestern states \\n iowa is making a comeback . \\n so are indiana  ohio and michigan . \\n the population of all four states is on the upswing  according to new census bureau estimates  following declines throughout the early 1980s . \\n the gains  to be sure  are rather small . \\n iowa  for instance  saw its population grow by 11 people  or 0.4 %  between 1987 and 1988  the census bureau says . \\n still  even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n\\'t grown at all since 1981 . \\n between 1987 and 1988  north dakota was the only state in the midwest to lose population  a loss of 4 people . \\n six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- illinois  kansas  minnesota  missouri  south dakota and wisconsin . \\n the northeast has been holding its own in the population race . \\n seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980  including new york  which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s . \\n and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade  they are growing again . \\n at the same time  several states in the south and E4817 have had their own population turnaround . \\n seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- E4817 E3957  mississippi  louisiana  oklahoma  montana  wyoming and alaska . \\n overall  though  the south and E4817 still outpace the northeast and midwest  and fast - growing states like E6706 and california ensure that the pattern will continue . \\n but the growth gap between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing . \\n more elderly maintain their independence \\n thanks to modern medicine  more couples are growing old together . \\n and even after losing a spouse  more of the elderly are staying independent . \\n a new census bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64 % of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988  up from 59 % in 1970 . \\n this does n\\'t mean they \\'re less likely to live alone  however . \\n that share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 . \\n what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives  such as children . \\n in 1988  10 % of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses  down from 15 % in 1970 . \\n as people get even older  many become widowed . \\n but even among those aged 75 and older  the share living with a spouse rose slightly  to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 . \\n like their younger counterparts  the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives . \\n only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988  down from 26 % in 1970 . \\n the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40 % from 32 % . \\n more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially . \\n careers count most for the well - to - do \\n many affluent people place personal success and money above family . \\n at least that \\'s what a survey by E2143 & young and yankelovich  E1335  shulman indicates . \\n two - thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs  while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . \\n being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group . \\n unlike most studies of the affluent market  this survey excluded the super-rich . \\n average household income for the sample was $ 194  and average net assets were reported as $ 775 . \\n the goal was to learn about one of today \\'s fastest - growing income groups  the upper - middle class . \\n although they represent only 2 % of the population  they control nearly one - third of discretionary income . \\n across the board  these consumers value quality  buy what they like rather than just what they need  and appreciate products that are distinctive . \\n despite their considerable incomes and assets  40 % of the respondents in the study do n\\'t feel financially secure  and one - fourth do n\\'t feel that they have made it . \\n twenty percent do n\\'t even feel they are financially well off . \\n many of the affluent are n\\'t comfortable with themselves  either . \\n about 40 % do n\\'t feel they \\'re more able than others . \\n while twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent  only 25 % give $ 2 or more to charity each year . \\n thirty - five percent attend religious services regularly ; at the same time  60 % feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one \\'s principles . \\n odds and ends \\n the number of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation \\'s largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 . \\n the american bankers association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks  up from 33 % in 1978 . \\n the share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... . \\n per - capita personal income in the u.s. grew faster than inflation last year  according to the bureau of economic analysis . \\n the amount of income divvied up for each man  woman and child was $ 16 in 1988  up 6.6 % from $ 15 in 1987 . \\n per capita personal income ranged from $ 11 in mississippi to $ 23 in connecticut ... . \\n there are 13.1 million students in college this fall  up 2 % from 1988  the national center for education statistics estimates . \\n about 54 % are women  and 44 % are part - time students . \\n this small E5795 suburb \\'s got trouble . \\n trouble with a capital t and that rhymes with p and that stands for pool . \\n more than 30 years ago  prof. E1749 E5331  the con man in E4099 willson \\'s `` the music man  \\'\\' warned the citizens of river city  iowa  against the game . \\n now kindred spirits on addison \\'s town council have barred the town \\'s fanciest hotel  the grand kempinski  from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge . \\n E5205 E5163 spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along addison \\'s main street . \\n and the mayor  in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to prof. E5331 \\'s  warned that `` alcohol leads to betting  which leads to fights . \\'\\' \\n the council \\'s action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years . \\n `` obviously they \\'re not in touch with what \\'s going on  \\'\\' says E6408 manske  vice president of the national pocket billiards association . \\n pool is hot in new york and chicago  [he] insists  where `` upscale  suit - and - tie places \\'\\' are adding tables . \\n with today \\'s tougher drunk driving laws  [he] adds  `` people do n\\'t want to just sit around and drink . \\'\\' \\n besides  rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the grand kempinski  where rooms average $ 200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ 3.50 a pop . \\n at the lounge  manager E4346 dyer wo n\\'t admit patrons in jeans  t - shirts or tennis shoes . \\n but a majority of the addison council did n\\'t buy those arguments . \\n introducing pool  argued councilwoman E3421 reinker  would be `` dangerous . \\n it would open a can of worms . \\'\\' \\n addison is no stranger to cans of worms  either . \\n after its previous mayor committed suicide last year  an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects  gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town \\'s coffers for trips and retreats . \\n the revelations embarrassed town officials  although they argued that the problems were n\\'t as severe as the media suggested . \\n now comes the pool flap . \\n `` i think there \\'s some people worried about something pretty ridiculous  \\'\\' councilman E719 E5935 says . \\n `` i thought this was all taken care of in ` the music man . \\n the only thing E3470 goldberg could praise about cbs \\'s new show `` island E5875 \\'\\' -lrb- leisure & arts  sept. 25 -rrb- was the local color ; unfortunately neither [he] nor the producers of the show have done their homework . \\n for instance : `` haole \\'\\' -lrb- white -rrb- is not the ultimate insult ; `` mainland haole \\'\\' is . \\n E1976 chamberlain dresses as a `` mainland haole  \\'\\' tucking in a hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves . \\n and the local expression for brother is `` brah  \\'\\' not `` bruddah . \\'\\' \\n and even if a nurse would wear flowers in [her] hair while on duty  if [she] were engaged [she] would know to wear them behind [her] left  not right  ear . \\n sorry  the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color . \\n E694 E2797 \\n of all the ethnic tensions in america  which is the most troublesome right now ? \\n a good bet would be the tension between blacks and jews in new york city . \\n or so it must seem to E6110 E4818  the veteran jewish comedian appearing in a new abc sitcom airing on E3030 nights -lrb- 9:30 - 10 p.m. edt -rrb- . \\n not only is mr. E4818 the star of `` chicken soup  \\'\\' [he] \\'s also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` duck soup  \\'\\' and [he] \\'s currently a man in hot water . \\n here  in neutral language  is the gist of mr. E4818 \\'s remarks  quoted first in the village voice while [he] was a paid spokesman for the E1590 giuliani mayoral campaign  and then in newsweek after [he] and the campaign parted company . \\n mr. E4818 said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks  so they support black candidates uncritically . \\n [he] said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination  so they  too  support black candidates uncritically . \\n [he] said that jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa . \\n of course  mr. E4818 did not use neutral language . \\n as a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the borscht belt  live television and the nightclub circuit  mr. E4818 instinctively reached for the vernacular . \\n [he] said jews were `` sick with complexes \\'\\' ; and [he] called E5249 dinkins  mr. giuliani \\'s black opponent  `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . \\'\\' \\n if mr. E4818 had used less derogatory language to articulate [his] amateur analysis of the voting behavior of [his] fellow new yorkers  would the water be quite so hot ? \\n it probably would  because few or none of the people upset by mr. E4818 \\'s remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of [his] comments and the fact that [he] used insulting language . \\n in addition  some of mr. E4818 \\'s critics have implied that [his] type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism . \\n for example  the new york state counsel for the naacp said that mr. E4818 is `` like a dinosaur . \\n people are fast leaving the place where [he] is stuck . \\'\\' \\n these critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group  such as `` polish jokes \\'\\' ; and the type that is double - edged  aiming inward as well as outward . \\n the latter typically is the humor of the underdog  and it was perfected by both blacks and jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves . \\n in the hands of a zealot like E1962 E5961  this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons . \\n but wielded by a pro like E6110 E4818  it is a constructive form of mischief . \\n why constructive ? \\n because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing  they are similar in one respect : both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict . \\n that \\'s why it \\'s dangerous to have well - intentioned thought police  on college campuses and elsewhere  taboo all critical mention of group differences . \\n as E4346 kristol wrote in the new york times just before the E4818 donnybrook  `` perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . \\'\\' \\n the question is  if group conflicts still exist -lrb- as undeniably they do -rrb-  and if mr. E4818 \\'s type of ethnic humor is passe  then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? \\n do n\\'t say the tv sitcom  because that happens to be a genre that  in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody  resembles politics more than it does comedy . \\n it is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue - collar bostonians in `` cheers \\'\\' ; children vs. adults in `` the cosby show . \\'\\' \\n but these are not the differences that make headlines . \\n in `` chicken soup  \\'\\' mr. E4818 plays E6110  a jewish bachelor courting E4332 -lrb- E5163 redgrave -rrb-  an irish widow and mother of three  against the wishes of [his] mother -lrb- E934 E776 -rrb- and [her] brother E5324 -lrb- E3130 maggart -rrb- . \\n it \\'s worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants . \\n at least  they both speak with strong accents  as do E6110 and E4332 . \\n it could n\\'t be more obvious that `` chicken soup \\'\\' is being made from an old recipe . \\n and a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an orthodox jew and a member of the nation of islam . \\n back in the 1920s  the play and movie versions of `` abie \\'s irish E1329 \\'\\' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of jewish and irish immigrants so popular that its author  E5489 E778  lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain . \\n and it has remained there  as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 cbs sitcom called `` E3634 loves E4598  \\'\\' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real - life marriage of E4099 E3792 and E5249 birney . \\n clearly  the question with `` chicken soup \\'\\' is not whether the pot will boil over  but whether it will simmer at all . \\n so far  the bubbles have been few and far between . \\n part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms  ever since the didactic days of E6330 lear  to preach about social issues . \\n to some extent  this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them . \\n for instance  E5324 dislikes E6110 not because [he] \\'s a shrewd jewish businessman  but because [he] quits [his] well - paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker . \\n even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and mr. E4818 \\'s comic persona . \\n the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -lrb- and occasionally in the middle -rrb-  when mr. E4818 slips into [his] standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself . \\n but too often  these routines lack spark because this sitcom  like all sitcoms  is timid about confronting mr. E4818 \\'s stock in trade - ethnic differences . \\n i \\'m not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the catholic - jewish dispute over the carmelite convent at auschwitz . \\n that issue  like racial tensions in new york city  will have to cool down  not heat up  before it can simmer . \\n but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. E4818 to interrupt [his] classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people \\'\\' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of miss america . \\n at your age  E6110  you ought to know that you ca n\\'t make soup without turning up the flame . \\n the official white house reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60 - year history of calm  right up through friday . \\n treasury secretary E7273 E2386 said in a statement friday that the stock - market decline `` does n\\'t signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy . \\'\\' \\n `` the economy  \\'\\' [he] added  `` remains well - balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . \\'\\' \\n sound familiar ? \\n here \\'s what E1305 E4860 said after the 1987 crash : `` the underlying economy remains sound . \\n there is nothing wrong with the economy ... all the indices are up . \\'\\' \\n heard that before ? \\n after the 1929 crash  E5713 hoover said : `` the fundamental business of the country ... is on a sound and prosperous basis . \\n E2691 E1003  57 years old  was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives . \\n [he] has been president and chief executive officer of amperex electronics corp.  a division of north american philips corp.  itself a subsidiary of n.v . philips of the netherlands . \\n E6289 j. E1198 jr.  68  who had been acting chief executive since E2265 14  will continue as chairman . \\n the former president and chief executive  E2966 w. markrud  resigned in E2265 . \\n the senate \\'s decision to approve a bare - bones deficit - reduction bill without a capital - gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year . \\n late friday night  the senate voted 87 - 7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened  rather than narrowed  the federal budget deficit . \\n lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special - interest tax breaks and spending increases . \\n `` we \\'re putting a deficit - reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit - reduction bill  \\'\\' said senate budget committee chairman E2691 sasser -lrb- d.  tenn . -rrb- . \\n but senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside  including a capital - gains tax cut . \\n in addition  the companion deficit - reduction bill already passed by the house includes a capital - gains provision . \\n house - senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while . \\n `` no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side  \\'\\' said senate minority leader E3470 dole -lrb- r.  kan . -rrb- . \\n but  [he] added  `` i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital - gains reform this year . \\'\\' \\n white house budget director E1976 darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n\\'t push to keep the capital - gains cut in the final version of the bill . \\n `` we do n\\'t need this as a way to get capital gains  \\'\\' [he] said . \\n house budget committee chairman E7401 panetta -lrb- d.  calif . -rrb- said in an interview  `` if that \\'s the signal that comes from the white house  that will help a great deal . \\'\\' \\n the senate \\'s decision was a setback for president bush and will make approval of a capital - gains tax cut less certain this year . \\n opponents of the cut are playing hardball . \\n senate majority leader E861 E7123 -lrb- d.  maine -rrb- said [he] was `` confident \\'\\' that any house - senate agreement on the deficit - reduction legislation would n\\'t include a capital - gains tax cut . \\n and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee  where tax legislation originates  said there are n\\'t any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year . \\'\\' \\n one obvious place to attach a capital - gains tax cut  and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit - reduction bill  is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit . \\n such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month . \\n the senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit - reduction through congress . \\n because the legislation has n\\'t been completed  president bush has until midnight tonight to enact across - the - board spending cuts mandated by the gramm - rudman deficit - reduction law . \\n senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the streamlined bill . \\n the house appears reluctant to join the senators . \\n a key is whether house republicans are willing to acquiesce to their senate colleagues \\' decision to drop many pet provisions . \\n `` although i am encouraged by the senate action  \\'\\' said chairman E3819 rostenkowski -lrb- d.  ill . -rrb- of the house ways and means committee  `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the senate . \\'\\' \\n another big question hovering over the debate is what president bush thinks . \\n [he] has been resisting a stripped - down bill without a guaranteed vote on [his] capital - gains tax cut . \\n but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital - gains issue on the floor  so they went ahead with the streamlined bill . \\n the senate bill was stripped of many popular  though revenue - losing  provisions  a number of which are included in the house - passed bill . \\n these include a child - care initiative and extensions of soon - to - expire tax breaks for low - income housing and research - and - development expenditures . \\n also missing from the senate bill is the house \\'s repeal of a law  called section 89  that compels companies to give rank - and - file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives . \\n one high - profile provision that was originally in the senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman E2125 bentsen -lrb- d.  texas -rrb- of the senate finance committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts . \\n mr. bentsen said [he] hopes the senate will consider that measure soon . \\n to the delight of some doctors  the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance committee that would have overhauled the entire physician - reimbursement system under medicare . \\n to the detriment of many low - income people  efforts to boost medicaid funding  especially in rural areas  also were stricken . \\n asked why senators were giving up so much  new mexico sen. E4623 domenici  the ranking republican on the senate budget committee  said  `` we \\'re looking like idiots . \\n things had just gone too far . \\'\\' \\n sen. dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator . \\n it worked  others said  because there were no exceptions : all revenue - losing provisions were stricken . \\n the senate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced . \\n in addition  the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long - distance telephone calls . \\n it no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed - contract method of accounting  which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden . \\n it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees . \\n also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum occupational safety and health administration penalties  which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 . \\n a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was excised . \\n the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen. E7123  who had proposed the streamlining . \\n mr. E7123 \\'s relations with budget director darman  who pushed for a capital - gains cut to be added to the measure  have been strained since mr. darman chose to bypass the maine democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill . \\n the deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990  and $ 26 billion over five years . \\n the revenue - raising provisions  which affect mostly corporations  would : \\n -- prevent companies that have made leveraged buy - outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy - outs  effective aug. 2  1989 . \\n -- require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received  effective the day after the tax bill is enacted . \\n -- close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans  effective E2265 6  1989  that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers . \\n the measure repeals a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an esop  if the esop owns less than 30 % of the employer \\'s stock . \\n -- curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities  such as zero - coupon bonds  that postpone cash interest payments . \\n -- raise $ 851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes . \\n -- speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies  effective E4684 1990 . \\n -- impose a tax on ozone - depleting chemicals  such as those used in air conditioners and in styrofoam  beginning at $ 1.10 a pound starting next year . \\n -- withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding . \\n -- change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly  effective next year . \\n -- restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash . \\n -- increase to $ 6 a person from $ 3 the international air - passenger departure tax  and impose a $ 3 - a - person tax on international departures by commercial ships . \\n the measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees . \\n among its provisions : \\n -- reduction of medicare spending in fiscal 1990 by some $ 2.8 billion  in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians . \\n the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year . \\n -- removal of the u.s. postal service \\'s operating budget from the federal budget  reducing the deficit by $ 1.77 billion . \\n a similar provision is in the house version . \\n -- authority for the federal aviation administration to raise $ 239 million by charging fees for commercial airline - landing rights at new york \\'s laguardia and E719 f.

E6408 lantos  chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing  alleging : \\n 1 . that your sept. 28 editorial `` kangaroo committees \\'\\' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading . \\n i thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative . \\n 2 . that mr. lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment . \\n yes  [he] did . \\n as i watched [him] on c - span  i heard [him] speak those lovely words about the E5515 of rights  which [he] quotes from the transcript of the hearings . \\n [he] did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of [his] support for the constitution . \\n [he] used about 56 words defending the witnesses \\' constitutional rights . \\n unfortunately  by my rough guess  [he] used better than 5 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the fifth . \\n [he] sandwiched [his] praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary . \\n as your editorial rightly pointed out  E4348 E1612  former hud secretary  and E1543 E4593  mr. E1612 \\'s former aide  `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the fifth amendment . \\n \\'\\' that certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading \\'\\' indicated by mr. lantos . \\n 3 . that [his] `` committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud . \\n my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court ... etc . \\'\\' \\n absolute rubbish . \\n by any `` reasonable man \\'\\' criterion  mr. lantos and [his] colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted . \\n apparently  their verdict is in . \\n right now they \\'re pursuing evidence . \\n that \\'s not a bad way to proceed  just somewhat different from standard american practice . \\n how was that practice referred to when i was in school ? \\n ah  yes  something called a E7343 chamber . \\n of course  mr. lantos doth protest that [his] subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change . \\n no doubt that \\'s partially true . \\n everything that mr. lantos says in [his] letter is partially true . \\n [he] \\'s right about [his] subcommittee \\'s responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials . \\n but if [his] explanation of motivation is true  why is [his] investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ? \\n why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ? \\n such as  what happened when congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ? \\n no  mr. lantos \\'s complaints simply wo n\\'t wash . \\n 4 . that the journal defends `` the sleaze  fraud  waste  embezzlement  influence - peddling and abuse of the public that took place while mr. E1612 was secretary of hud  \\'\\' etc. and so forth . \\n no  to my mind  the journal did not `` defend sleaze  fraud  waste  embezzlement  influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust ... \\'\\' \\n it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense . \\n the problem  which the journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles  is not the likes of mr. lantos  who after all is really a bit player on the stage  but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary / judicial body . \\n -lrb- of course  we \\'ve also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . -rrb- \\n the system is the problem  not an individual member . \\n individuals can always have their hands slapped . \\n it \\'s when such slapping does n\\'t occur that we \\'ve got trouble . \\n i do not by any means defend hud management . \\n but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -lrb- and  yes  maybe criminality -rrb- within hud could possibly generate . \\n the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` tail E6995 E1048 \\'\\' mccarthy did [his] work . \\n E5256 E3666 \\n parsippany  n.j . \\n i disagree with the statement by mr. lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former hud officials who assert their fifth amendment privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings . \\n the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled  in any criminal case  to be a witness against himself . \\'\\' \\n this privilege against self - incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify . \\n thus  in a criminal case  a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant \\'s failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness  thus forcing [him] to `` take the fifth . \\'\\' \\n the privilege  however  has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only . \\n the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the fifth amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . \\'\\' \\n E3792 v. palmingiano  425 u.s. 308 -lrb- 1976 -rrb- . \\n thus  in a civil case  a defendant may be called as a witness  [he] may be forced to testify or take the fifth  and [his] taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against [him] in the civil matter . \\n [he] may take the fifth in a civil matter only if [he] has a good faith and justifiable belief that [his] testimony may subject [him] to criminal prosecution . \\n allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one \\'s testimony harms [him] in the civil matter  but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against [him] in a subsequent criminal prosecution . \\n absent the risk of such prosecution  a court may order the defendant to testify . \\n thus  when mr. E1612 asserted the fifth in a noncriminal proceeding  particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel  one must conclude that [he] held a good - faith  justifiable belief that [his] testimony could be used against [him] in a subsequent criminal prosecution . \\n the subcommittee  congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with mr. E1612 \\'s own belief that [his] testimony could help convict [him] of a crime . \\n drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the fifth amendment shield against self - incrimination . \\n E2917 s. spalsbury jr . \\n estes E1917  colo . \\n it was friday the 13th  and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points . \\n just a coincidence ? \\n or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ? \\n in academia  a so - called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors . \\n E3470 kolb and E4641 rodriguez  professors of finance at the university of miami  found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th . \\n but their study  which spanned the 1962 - 85 period  has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data . \\n in the \\'70s  the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the you - know - what . \\n but the date tends to be a plus  not a minus  for stocks  according to E4216 E359  a collector of stock market lore . \\n another study found that the 82 fridays the 13th in the 1940 - 1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than fridays in general  which tend to be strong days for stock prices . \\n on the only other friday the 13th this year  the dow jones industrial average rose about four points . \\n professor kolb says the original study  titled friday the 13th  part vii  was published tongue - in - cheek . \\n in a similar vein  [he] adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and saturday \\'s full moon could have played a part  too  in friday \\'s market activity . \\n friday  october 13  1989 \\n the key u.s. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n\\'t always represent actual transactions . \\n prime rate : \\n 10 1/2 % . \\n the base rate on corporate loans at large u.s. money center commercial banks . \\n federal funds : \\n 8 13/16 % high  8 1/2 % low  8 5/8 % near closing bid  8 3/4 % offered . \\n reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $ 1 million or more . \\n source : E1501 prebon -lrb- u.s.a . -rrb- inc . \\n discount rate : \\n 7 % . \\n the charge on loans to depository institutions by the new york federal reserve bank . \\n call money : \\n 9 3/4 % to 10 % . \\n the charge on loans to brokers on stock exchange collateral . \\n commercial paper placed directly by general motors acceptance corp. : \\n 8.60 % 30 to 44 days ;

E6990  president of chicago - based E715 capital management inc.  which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks . \\n mr. E6990 spent half [his] cash on hand friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . \\'\\' \\n [he] expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further . \\n denver - based portfolio manager E2691 E6134 was n\\'t daunted when friday \\'s rout shaved $ 40 million from the value of the $ 752 million E910 fund [he] oversees . \\n `` i waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through  \\'\\' [he] said . \\n then [he] jumped into the market : \\n `` i spent $ 30 million in the last half - hour . \\'\\' \\n other money managers also opened their wallets . \\n `` i was buying at the close -lrb- friday -rrb- and i \\'ll be buying again because i know we \\'re getting good value  \\'\\' said E4466 a. moran  president of moran asset management inc.  greenwich  conn . \\n `` there is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . \\'\\' \\n unlike mutual funds  which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money  big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . \\n most often  they do just that  because stocks have proved to be the best - performing long - term investment  attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone . \\n `` if you bought after the crash  you did very very well off the bottom  \\'\\' said E5466 b. timbers  chief investment officer of chicago - based kemper financial services inc . \\n the $ 56 billion california public employees retirement system  for one  added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago . \\n `` the last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long - term holders  and that they ca n\\'t react to short - term events  good or bad  \\'\\' said E5466 l. nesbitt  senior vice president for the pension consultants wilshire associates in santa E967  calif . \\n `` those that pulled out -lrb- of stocks -rrb- regretted it  \\'\\' [he] said  `` so i doubt you \\'ll see any significant changes \\'\\' in institutional portfolios as a result of friday \\'s decline . \\n stocks  as measured by the standard & poor \\'s 500 - stock index  have been stellar performers this year  rising 27.97 % before friday \\'s plunge  excluding dividends . \\n even friday \\'s slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 %  well above the annual average for stocks over several decades . \\n `` you could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market  \\'\\' said E2691 d. awad  president of new york - based bmi capital corp . \\n mr. awad  however  worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days . \\n it can happen before you can turn around . \\'\\' \\n [he] said [he] discerns many parallels with 1987  including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading . \\n `` the only thing you do n\\'t have  \\'\\' [he] said  `` is the ` portfolio insurance \\' phenomenon overlaid on the rest . \\'\\' \\n most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique  which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash . \\n not really insurance  this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of s&p futures contracts . \\n in its severest test  the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n\\'t work  as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . \\n even without portfolio insurance  market conditions were grim friday  money managers said . \\n E7133 weisman  whose new york - based chilmark capital partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months  said [he] was besieged by wall street firms friday asking [him] to take stock off their hands . \\n `` we got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything  \\'\\' said mr. weisman  who  happy with [his] returns on investments chalked up earlier  declined the offers . \\n mr. weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again  trapping more investors . \\n `` i think it will be a rigor mortis rally  \\'\\' [he] said . \\n meanwhile  friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally . \\n especially gleeful were the short sellers  who have been pounded by this year \\'s market climb . \\n the shorts sell borrowed shares  hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price . \\n the nation \\'s largest short - selling operation is feshbach brothers  palo alto  calif.  which said last E4615 that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point . \\n all that now has changed . \\n `` we \\'re ahead for the year because of friday  \\'\\' said the firm \\'s E4903 feshbach . \\n `` we \\'re not making a killing  but we had a good day . \\n food and drug administration spokesman E285 nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning vitarine pharmaceuticals inc. to the u.s. attorney \\'s office in baltimore . \\n neither vitarine nor any of the springfield gardens  n.y.  company \\'s officials or employees have been charged with any crimes . \\n vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a smithkline beecham plc product as its own in tests . \\n mr. nesbit also said the fda has asked bolar pharmaceutical co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic . \\n but so far the company has n\\'t complied with that request  the spokesman said . \\n bolar  the subject of a criminal investigation by the fda and the inspector general \\'s office of the health and human services department  only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers  mostly wholesalers  \\'\\' mr. nesbit said . \\n bolar  of copiague  n.y.  earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug . \\n the fda has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that bolar substituted the brand - name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of macrodantin . \\n bolar has denied that it switched the brand - name product for its own in such testing . \\n the E4817 german retailer asko deutsche kaufhaus ag plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the netherlands . \\n the eventual court decision could become a landmark in dutch corporate law because the lawsuit asko plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management - controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders . \\n up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged  though unsuccessfully  asko \\'s dutch lawyers noted . \\n should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense  asko will then ask the court to overturn such a vote - diluting maneuver recently deployed by koninklijke ahold nv . \\n asko says the dutch - based international food retailer had n\\'t reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of asko and other shareholders . \\n speaking through its dutch lawyers  asko also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in ahold . \\n it was previously thought asko held a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since july . \\n a spokesman for ahold said [his] company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred - share issue . \\n [he] termed asko \\'s legal actions as `` unproductive \\'\\' to international cooperation among european retailers . \\n E5966 manhattan bank chairman E6417 butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal republican  but on friday morning [he] had few kind words for president bush \\'s economic policy - making . \\n `` there are some very significant issues out there  such as the fiscal deficit  the trade deficit  our relations with japan  that have to be the subject of major initiatives  \\'\\' [he] said in an interview . \\n `` i \\'d like to see that initiative  and i have n\\'t . \\n there is n\\'t a big shot  an agenda . \\'\\' \\n a few hours later  the stock market dropped 190 points . \\n politicians tried to finger each other for the blame  although many analysts doubt that E4477 was singly responsible for wall street \\'s woes . \\n but mr. butcher \\'s comments make one thing clear : some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy . \\n consider this : \\n -- by 11:59 p.m. tonight  president bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic  across - the - board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm - rudman budget law . \\n the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit - cutting bill . \\n `` we simply do n\\'t have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices  \\'\\' house budget committee chairman E7401 panetta -lrb- d.  calif . -rrb- said yesterday on nbc news \\'s `` meet the press . \\'\\' \\n -- for the last two weeks  the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy . \\n the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the fed has been resisting . \\n `` one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the treasury department and the federal reserve board  \\'\\' said E2656 kudlow  a E296  stearns & co. economist  on abc \\'s `` this week . \\'\\' \\n -- the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers . \\n last month  transportation secretary E916 skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by klm E5721 dutch airlines . \\n but [he] has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision . \\n and [he] has kept mum on how [his] decision might affect a bid for united airlines  which includes a big stake by british airways plc . \\n some analysts say uncertainty about E4477 \\'s anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . \\n in many ways  the backdrop to friday \\'s stock decline is eerily similar to that of october 1987 \\'s 508 - point crash . \\n then  as now  the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold . \\n the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy  although at that time it was with E4817 german officials rather than the federal reserve . \\n and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax - writing house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department -- were making markets nervous . \\n the 1987 crash brought the E4860 administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit  resulting in a two - year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period . \\n but  barring further drops in the market this week  a similar outcome does n\\'t seem likely this year . \\n lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday \\'s drop  by itself  is n\\'t enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit - reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far - reaching than last spring \\'s gimmick - ridden plan  which still is n\\'t fully implemented . \\n one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n\\'t likely to come about is that  as everyone learned in 1987  the economy and the market can survive a one - day 508 - point tumble . \\n `` everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929  that we were looking at a recession  \\'\\' rep. panetta said yesterday in an interview . \\n `` that did not happen . \\n they learned they could survive it without much problem . \\'\\' \\n but administration officials privately agree with mr. panetta  who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . \\'\\' \\n in that case  there will be plenty of blame to go around . \\n `` there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut  \\'\\' said senate finance committee chairman E2125 bentsen -lrb- d.  texas -rrb- . \\n nevertheless  it clearly will take more than friday \\'s 190 - point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director E1976 darman over the capital - gains fight . \\n E5331 democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush \\'s claim that the capital - gains cut was part of E4397 \\'s budget accord and [his] insistence on combining it with the deficit - reduction legislation . \\n `` there is no prospect of any so - called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n\\'t live up to this year \\'s deal  \\'\\' senate majority leader E861 E7123 -lrb- d.  maine -rrb- said yesterday on cbs news \\'s `` face the nation . \\'\\' \\n during last week \\'s maneuverings on the deficit - cutting bill and the capital - gains issue  there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds . \\n at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit - reduction legislation  white house spokesman E6996 fitzwater told reporters that it was the president \\'s policy to include it . \\n when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation  oregon sen. E720 packwood  the ranking gop member of the tax - writing senate finance committee  hailed it . \\n asked if the administration agreed  [he] curtly replied : `` the adminstration will have to speak for itself . \\'\\' \\n friday \\'s market tumble could spur action on reconciling the house and senate versions of the deficit - reduction measure  a process that is n\\'t expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . \\n senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate  which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . \\n `` the market needs a strong signal that we \\'re serious about deficit reduction  and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill \\'\\' of similar provisions  sen. E6366 rudman -lrb- r.  n.h . -rrb- . said yesterday . \\n the white house office of management and budget  whose calculations determine whether the gramm - rudman targets are met  estimated that the house - passed deficit - reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion  almost half of the congressional budget office \\'s estimate of $ 11.0 billion . \\n rep. panetta said that omb \\'s figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across - the - board cuts  but added : `` we \\'re getting very close to the margins here . \\'\\' \\n no one in E4477 was willing to take the blame for provoking friday \\'s drop in the stock market . \\n but some players were quick to seize the moment . \\n before the sun had set on friday  E1976 rahn  the supply - side chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce  issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . \\n `` investors  who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell  were spooked  \\'\\' [he] said . \\n `` there have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital - gains tax cut  \\'\\' sen. E7123 said during [his] television appearance  `` but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others . \\n honeywell inc. and international business machines corp. received air force contracts

of jaguar shares . \\n the no. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the british luxury - car maker  the maximum allowed under current united kingdom government restrictions . \\n general motors corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with jaguar before E6138 began buying shares . \\n gm said it still is talking with jaguar about acquiring a minority interest . \\n investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is  `` on margin \\'\\' -- may be more worried than most following friday \\'s market drop . \\n that \\'s because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans . \\n in october 1987  these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market . \\n typically  a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value . \\n if the investor does n\\'t put up the extra cash to satisfy the call  the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities . \\n but some big brokerage firms said they do n\\'t expect major problems as a result of margin calls . \\n margin calls since friday `` have been higher than usual  but reasonable  \\'\\' a spokesman for shearson lehman hutton inc. said . \\n E5049 lynch & co. officials `` do n\\'t expect -lcb- margin calls -rcb- to be as big a factor as in 1987 \\'\\' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin  a spokesman said . \\n E3684 quackenbush  senior vice president at E6289 schwab corp.  the san E960 - based discount brokerage firm  said [he] did n\\'t expect any immediate problems with margin calls for schwab customers . \\n [he] said schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have

\\n by the end of last year  multinational companies coming to invest in shandong were over one hundred  among which 26 were ranked the top 100 in the world . \\n these multinational companies \\' investment projects are large in scale  high in technology  and strong in their industrial promotion . \\n new breakthroughs were achieved in shandong \\'s methods of utilizing foreign capital . \\n since qingdao beer and shandong huaneng succeeded in respectively issuing h - shares and n - shares in hong kong and the us  last year  5 more share - holding companies  such as shandong \\'s chenmin paper manufacturing group  jinan \\'s qingqi group  yantai \\'s zhangyu group  xinhua \\'s pharmacy group and lutai \\'s textile group  etc. also entered the market issuing foreign capital shares  altogether attracting 265 million us dollars of foreign capital . \\n by the end of last year  seven enterprises in shandong province issued h - shares  n - shares or b - shares  altogether attracting over 700 million us dollars of foreign capital . \\n new progress has also been made in utilizing foreign capital for infrastructure  foundation industries and new high level technology projects . \\n in the area of energy  shandong \\'s china power generation company  ltd. obtained the state \\'s approval . \\n with a total project investment of nearly 2.3 billion us dollars and over 1 billion us dollars of contracted foreign capital  it is currently shandong province \\'s largest project utilizing foreign capital . \\n in agriculture  the integrated agricultural development project invested in by australia \\'s southern australia -- shandong stock - holding company  ltd. in the yellow river delta region has a total investment of nearly 30 million us dollars and over 10 million us dollars of contracted foreign capital . \\n it is currently shandong \\'s largest integrated agricultural development project . \\n in the area of new high level technology  the investment projects of world famous multinational companies such as the us \\'s eton  germany \\'s deutsch  the uk \\'s imperial chemicals  etc. all have first - class international levels of technology . \\n these projects powerfully bring about optimization and improvement of shandong province \\'s industrial structure . \\n in infrastructure  a number of expressway projects have been formally signed with the outside  and a number of municipal public infrastructure merchant - invitation projects have also been announced overseas  signifying the complete start of utilizing foreign capital in the areas of shandong \\'s infrastructure . \\n the economic development district has become a hotspot for attracting foreign merchant investment . \\n last year  shandong \\'s various types of economic development districts recently approved over 1480 projects utilizing foreign capital  accounting for more than 24 % of the total of the entire province . \\n over 900 million us dollars of foreign capital was actually utilized  increasing nearly 40 % compared with the same period the previous year . \\n the total industrial output completed by enterprises within the district for the year was over 47 billion us dollars  increasing by nearly 80 % compared with the previous year  and had nearly 1.7 billion us dollars of foreign export currency  increasing by 31 % compared with the same period the previous year . \\n as a new point of growth of shandong \\'s open economy  the economic development district is showing development vitality that grows stronger daily . \\n last year  the total output of shandong province reached over 19.7 billion us dollars  increasing by over 10 % compared with the previous year . \\n among this  exports broke through 13 billion us dollars  increasing by 25 % compared with the same period the previous year . \\n export values ranked fourth in the nation  and the growth rate ranked second among china \\'s main coastal provinces and cities . \\n -lrb- end -rrb- \\n in 1997  mexico \\'s total amount of foreign trade broke through 220 billion us dollars  which created a new historical record . \\n however  in reviewing mexico \\'s foreign trade situation this year  it might be appropriate to say that it is between joy and sorrow . \\n the joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still maintains a strong growth momentum  and has realized trade surpluses for the third year in a row  whereas the sorrow is that the amount of trade surplus has sharply reversed  and this year  a relatively large deficit may appear . \\n according to official journals published recently by mexico \\'s treasury department  mexico \\'s foreign trade in 1997 continued to grow rapidly  the total amount of imports and exports reached 220.178 billion us dollars  18.85 % higher than that of the previous year  and within that the amount of exports was 110.380 billion us dollars  the amount of imports was 109.798 billion us dollars  15 % and 22.7 % higher than 1996  respectively . \\n the trade surplus was 582 million us dollars . \\n foreign trade occupies a pivotal position in mexico \\'s economy . \\n at present  exports account for more than 30 % of its gdp  which is one of the primary economic growth forces . \\n after the outbreak of mexico \\'s financial crisis in 1994  mexico \\'s currency  the peso was greatly devalued  thus greatly strengthening mexico \\'s export competitiveness . \\n in the last several years  the government has been vigorously supporting exports  and exports grew rapidly . \\n in 1995  the situation of successive foreign trade deficit reversed  and up to now  has maintained trade surpluses for three years in a row . \\n however  in the past three years  mexico \\'s foreign trade surplus showed a substantial degradation : 7.889 billion us dollars in 1995  6.424 billion us dollars in 1996  and only 582 million us dollars last year . \\n especially deserving to be pointed out is that  after the first monthly deficit in july last year  the rest of the year saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling  roaring from 20 million us dollars in july to 722 million us dollars in december  reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number . \\n local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in the second half of last year was mainly due to an overly high import growth rate  which is even higher than that of exports . \\n in the second half of last year  the average growth rate of imports was 6 % to 7 % higher than that of exports . \\n among import sectors  swift growth comes mainly from imports of consumer products and capital goods  39.9 % and 38.2 % higher than that of 1996 respectively . \\n the growth of imports of semi-finished products was up by 18.8 % . \\n secondly  the overly high valuation of the peso is also an indispensable factor . \\n an overly high peso exchange rate stimulated imports  but hindered exports . \\n it is commonly known that in 1994  before the outbreak of the financial crisis  the trade deficit was once as high as more than 18 billion us dollars . \\n the huge trade deficit was one of the internal reasons that triggered this crisis . \\n hence  the trade situation last year has caused extreme concern among people from economic circles  who even predicted that in 1998  foreign trade deficit would revive . \\n they pointed out that  this year  except for an overly high peso exchange rate  exports would also face some new unfavorable factors . \\n for instance  asian currency devaluation will decrease export competitiveness  and the fall of oil price will significantly reduce oil revenues . \\n under these circumstances  if the import growth momentum can not be restrained  this year  a trade deficit of 4 to 5 billion us dollars may appear . \\n -lrb- end -rrb- \\n xinhua news agency  beijing  march 9th \\n the statistics from the general administration of customs show

opening up in the 1980\\'s was closely related to the situation at that time of the  peafowl flying towards the southeast  -lrb- human talents from all over  one after another  going to guangdong -rrb- . \\n with the overall opening up of china \\'s coastal areas  frontier areas  riverside areas and capital cities of every province since the 1990\\'s  the flow of talent tends to be multi-directional and the competition has become increasingly fierce . \\n further enhancing the attraction to talented persons has become the key point of guangdong \\'s further development . \\n limo qin  director of the talent exchange and service center of guangdong province has done analysis and said :  the economic development rate of guangdong in 1993 was at an intermediate level of that in the recent years . \\n in that year it introduced more than 100 talented persons of various types . \\n developing at this rate  in the next ten years  not including graduates from higher education institutes  guangdong \\'s talent gap is conservatively estimated to surpass 1 million . \\n therefore  further opening minds and introducing talent are guidelines of guangdong \\'s policy regarding talented people .  \\n in recent years  there have been more and more climaxes in guangdong \\'s talent market . \\n each year  there are several large - scale talent employment fairs whose service for more than 1000 employers and more than 10 applicants lasts for more than half a month . \\n in the whole year of 1993  talent exchange centers of personnel departments across the province registered more than 463 people applying for jobs . \\n there were 62 people with documents of transfer or employment processed  of which 45.8 % had intermediate or advanced level titles of specialty or profession  and 78 % had an undergraduate or higher degree . \\n talent introduction departments also actively went out visiting science and technology management talent . \\n fourteen cities such as guangzhou  shenzhen  etc. went to beijing for the first national talent and technology exchange fair  where they established a total of 100 employment booths . \\n at the beginning of 1993  six cities such as zhuhai  foshan  etc. also organized a delegation to advertise in the us and E4944 for students studying abroad . \\n 1006 students abroad filled out application forms  and quite a

standing talent market  such  all - weather  talent exchange organizations have rapidly spread in the zhujiang delta and all cities within the province . \\n now  there are fifteen cities with relatively more advanced economies in the province having built up regular markets . \\n in order to further enhance the attraction of talent  to break through the barrier of  departmental ownership  of talent  and to promote the flow of talent by forming mechanisms of independent employment and job choice  guangdong province has also paid greater attention to the formulation of relevant policies and regulations . \\n limo qin said in [his] introduction that in recent years the provincial government has successively issued documents such as  temporary regulations on encouraging persons

municipal departments  and the district parliament will only exist till E2265 30th  1997 . \\n this is the inevitable outcome of the uk terminating its rule over hong kong at the designated time . \\n

basic law and relevant resolutions of the national people \\'s congress . \\n currently  the preparatory work committee of the preparatory committee of the hong kong special administrative region is studying relevant specific issues on forming the hong kong special administrative region \\'s first legislative assembly  and will submit suggestions to the preparatory committee that will be established in 1996 . \\n a reporter asked : on E4684 23rd  the us president signed the  1995 financial year overseas activities fund appropriation act  in which it is stipulated that any donation made by the us to the un population fund must not be used in china . \\n what is your opinion of this ? \\n guofang shen said that this bill is a bill carrying political discrimination and extremely unfriendly to china . \\n it is an insult to china \\'s family planning policy  has seriously violated the mission and principles of the un charter  and sets a very bad precedent for the provision of aid to multi-lateral organizations of the un . \\n [he] pointed out that  we resolutely oppose any country providing donations with attached conditions to the population fund . \\n we do not hope to see the work of the un population fund receiving interference or even being diverted from its principles and mission due to pressure from the us .  \\n -lrb- end -rrb- \\n xinhua news agency  beijing

currently rising . \\n the holding of the 6th far east and south pacific disabled games will provide more impetus for this trend . \\n each development step of handicapped sports can not be separated from the concern and support of the party and the government . \\n at the beginning of the establishment of the people \\'s republic of china  social welfare services and schools for blind children and deaf people were established successively everywhere . \\n welfare factories developed activities such as broadcast exercises  etc. and schools established physical education . \\n as a part of the cause for the disabled  disabled sports began to grow . \\n every year  the nation allocates special funds to be used in developing handicapped sports activities . \\n nationwide handicapped sports games began to be held in the late 1950\\'s . \\n the games accelerated improvement and drove popularization . \\n the handicapped sports cause has gradually grown . \\n since the reform and opening up  the chinese economy has developed rapidly . \\n this enabled more people to put money and material resource into the disabled sports cause . \\n in the short 10 years  the cause has achieved success of attention from china and abroad . \\n it is reasonable to believe that the disabled cause will be increasingly recognized and supported as china \\'s overall national strength escalates . \\n the handicapped sports cause will also have broad development . \\n the establishment and healthiness of disabled sports organizations provide organizational assurance for the development of the sports cause for handicapped people . \\n the chinese injured and disabled people sports association -lrb- renamed to the chinese disabled sports association in 1990 -rrb- was established in october  1983 . \\n after this a succession of handicapped sports organizations were established throughout china . \\n in 1985  the chinese mentally impaired and blind sports associations were also established . \\n having organization and leadership  activities such as the games and competitions  etc. were increasingly and frequently held . \\n the enthusiasm of handicapped people participating in the sports activities was unprecedentedly increasing  sports levels continually improve and the reserve force is growing . \\n three national disabled games were held respectively in hefei  tangshan and guangzhou . \\n the scale became larger and larger and the level became higher and higher . \\n the games have received more broad attention and support of the public  and have attracted more disabled people to take part in the events . \\n since 1984 the chinese disabled sports association has become a member of 8 international disabled sports organizations successively  such as the international para olympic committee  etc. and has established relations with disabled sports organizations in various countries and areas and taken part in international events such as the special olympic games  etc . \\n in competitions and contacts  disabled chinese people have revealed extraordinary physical abilities  achieved excellent results  enhanced friendship with disabled people from various countries and areas and contributed to the development of physical activities for disabled people around the world . \\n  the guaranteed law for disabled persons in the people \\'s republic of china   which was drafted and implemented in 1991  stipulates to organize and support disabled people to develop mass sports activities  to hold special games and to participate in important international competitions and communication . \\n the guarantee of the law has and will continue to boost the vigorous development of the sports cause for china \\'s disabled . \\n holding the 6th E3336 - pacific special olympic games in beijing will motivate all of society to better understand and support disabled sports . \\n it will make the public more conscious of helping disabled people and encourage more disabled people to take part in physical activities . \\n it will  therefore  greatly assist in the development of the sports cause for china \\'s disabled . \\n truly  the foundation of disabled sports in china is not very strong  popularization is not yet widespread  and compared with some developed countries  still has a large gap . \\n however  the  impact  of the far south games foreshadows a bright future for this civilized and progressive cause . \\n -lrb- end -rrb- \\n in the script  mongolian handicapped athletes prepare for

news agency  E4684 31st . \\n E1293 got into a boat and went back across the lake to [his] own town . \\n some people brought to [him] a man who was paralyzed and was lying on a mat . \\n E1293 saw that these people had much faith . \\n so [he] said to the paralyzed man  `` young man  you will be glad to hear this . \\n your sins are forgiven . \\'\\' \\n some of the teachers of the law heard what E1293 said . \\n they said to themselves  `` what an insult to god for this man to say that ! \\'\\' \\n E1293 knew what they were thinking . \\n so [he] said  `` why are you thinking such evil thoughts ? \\n the E5875 of man has power on earth to forgive sins . \\n but how can i prove this to you ? \\n maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say  \\' your sins are forgiven . \\' \\n there \\'s no proof that it really happened . \\n but what if i say to the man  \\' stand up and walk \\' ? \\n then you will be able to see that i really have this power . \\'\\' \\n so E1293 said to the paralyzed man  `` stand up . \\n take your mat and go home . \\'\\' \\n the man stood up and went home . \\n the people saw this and they were amazed . \\n they praised god for letting someone have such power . \\n when E1293 was leaving  [he] saw a man named E4881 sitting at the place for collecting taxes . \\n E1293 said to [him]  `` follow me . \\'\\' \\n so [he] got up and followed E1293 . \\n E1293 ate dinner at E4881 \\'s house . \\n many tax collectors and others with bad reputations came and ate with [him] and [his] followers . \\n the pharisees saw that E1293 was eating with these people . \\n they asked [his] followers  `` why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 heard them say this . \\n so [he] said to them  `` it is the sick people who need a doctor  not those who are healthy . \\n you need to go and learn what this scripture means : \\' i do n\\'t want animal sacrifices ; i want you to show kindness to people . \\' \\n i did not come to invite good people . \\n i came to invite sinners . \\'\\' \\n then the followers of E719 came to E1293 and said  `` we and the pharisees fast often  but your followers do n\\'t ever fast . \\n why ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` at a wedding the friends of the bridegroom are not sad while [he] is with them . \\n they can not fast then . \\n but the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them . \\n then they will fast . \\n `` when someone sews a patch over a hole in an old coat  they never use a piece of cloth that has not already been shrunk . \\n if they do  the patch will shrink and pull away from the coat . \\n then the hole will be worse . \\n also  people never pour new wine into old wineskins . \\n they would break  the wine would spill out  and the wineskins would be ruined . \\n people always put new wine into new wineskins  which wo n\\'t break  and the wine stays good . \\'\\' \\n while E1293 was still talking  a leader of the synagogue came to [him] . \\n the leader bowed down before [him] and said  `` my daughter has just died . \\n but if you will come and touch [her] with your hand  [she] will live again . \\'\\' \\n so E1293 and [his] followers went with the man . \\n on the way  there was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years . \\n [she] came close behind E1293 and touched the bottom of [his] coat . \\n [she] was thinking  `` if i can touch [his] coat  i will be healed . \\'\\' \\n E1293 turned and saw the woman . \\n [he] said  `` be happy  dear woman . \\n you are made well because you believed . \\'\\' \\n then the woman was healed . \\n E1293 continued going with the jewish leader and went into the leader \\'s house . \\n [he] saw people there who make music for funerals . \\n and [he] saw a crowd of people crying loudly . \\n E1293 said  `` go away . \\n the girl is not dead . \\n [she] is only sleeping . \\'\\' \\n but the people laughed at [him] . \\n after the people were put out of the house  E1293 went into the girl \\'s room . \\n [he] held the girl \\'s hand  and the girl stood up . \\n the news about this spread all around the area . \\n as E1293 was going away from there  two blind men followed [him] . \\n they said loudly  `` show kindness to us  E5875 of E5249 . \\'\\' \\n E1293 went inside  and the blind men went with [him] . \\n [he] asked them  `` do you believe that i am able to make you see again ? \\'\\' \\n they answered  `` yes  lord  we believe . \\'\\' \\n then E1293 touched their eyes and said  `` you believe that i can make you see again  so it will happen . \\'\\' \\n then the men were able to see . \\n E1293 gave them a strong warning . \\n [he] said  `` do n\\'t tell anyone about this . \\'\\' \\n but they left and spread the news about E1293 all around that area . \\n as these two men were leaving  some people brought another man to E1293 . \\n this man could not talk because [he] had a demon inside [him] . \\n E1293 forced the demon out  and the man was able to talk . \\n the people were amazed and said  `` we have never seen anything like this in E7074 . \\'\\' \\n but the pharisees said  `` the ruler of demons is the one that gives [him] power to force demons out . \\'\\' \\n E1293 traveled through all the towns and villages . \\n [he] taught in their synagogues and told people the good news about god \\'s kingdom . \\n [he] healed all kinds of diseases and sicknesses . \\n E1293 saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless -- like sheep without a shepherd to lead them . \\n E1293 said to [his] followers  `` there is such a big harvest of people to bring in . \\n but there are only a few workers to help harvest them . \\n god owns the harvest . \\n ask [him] to send more workers to help gather [his] harvest . \\'\\' \\n after E1293 said all these things  [he] left galilee . \\n [he] went into the area of judea on the other side of the E4576 river . \\n many people followed [him] . \\n E1293 healed the sick people there . \\n some pharisees came to E1293 . \\n they tried to make [him] say something wrong . \\n they asked [him]  `` is it right for a man to divorce [his] wife for any reason [he] chooses ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` surely you have read this in the scriptures : when god made the world  \\' [he] made people male and female . \\' \\n and god said  \\' that is why a man will leave [his] father and mother and be joined to [his] wife . \\n and the two people will become one . \\' \\n so they are no longer two  but one . \\n god has joined them together  so no one should separate them . \\'\\' \\n the pharisees asked  `` then why did E5222 give a command allowing a man to divorce [his] wife by writing a certificate of divorce ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` E5222 allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept god \\'s teaching . \\n but divorce was not allowed in the beginning . \\n i tell you that whoever divorces [his] wife  except for the problem of sexual sin  and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . \\'\\' \\n the followers said to E1293  `` if that is the only reason a man can divorce [his] wife  it is better not to marry . \\'\\' \\n [he] answered  `` this statement is true for some  but not for everyone -- only for those who have been given this gift . \\n there are different reasons why some men do n\\'t marry . \\n some were born without the ability to produce children . \\n others were made that way later in life . \\n and others have given up marriage because of god \\'s kingdom . \\n this is for anyone who is able to accept it . \\'\\' \\n then the people brought their little children to E1293 so that [he] could lay [his] hands on them to bless them and pray for them . \\n when the followers saw this  they told the people to stop bringing their children to [him] . \\n but E1293 said  `` let the little children come to me . \\n do n\\'t stop them  because god \\'s kingdom belongs to people who are like these children . \\'\\' \\n after E1293 blessed the children  [he] left there . \\n a man came to E1293 and asked  `` teacher  what good thing must i do to have eternal life ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` why do you ask me about what is good ? \\n only god is good . \\n but if you want to have eternal life  obey the law \\'s commands . \\'\\' \\n the man asked  `` which ones ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` \\' you must not murder anyone  you must not commit adultery  you must not steal  you must not tell lies about others  you must respect your father and mother  \\' and \\' love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . \\' \\'\\' \\n the young man said  `` i have obeyed all these commands . \\n what else do i need ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` if you want to be perfect  then go and sell all that you own . \\n give the money to the poor  and you will have riches in heaven . \\n then come and follow me ! \\'\\' \\n but when the young man heard E1293 tell [him] to give away [his] money  [he] was sad . \\n [he] did n\\'t want to do this  because [he] was very rich . \\n so [he] left . \\n then E1293 said to [his] followers  `` the truth is  it will be very hard for a rich person to enter god \\'s kingdom . \\n yes  i tell you  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter god \\'s kingdom . \\'\\' \\n the followers were amazed to hear this . \\n they asked  `` then who can be saved ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 looked at them and said  `` this is something that people can not do . \\n but god can do anything . \\'\\' \\n E3520 said to [him]  `` we left everything we had and followed you . \\n so what will we have ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 said to them  `` when the time of the new world comes  the E5875 of man will sit on [his] great and glorious throne . \\n and i can promise that you who followed me will sit on twelve thrones  and you will judge the twelve tribes of E7074 . \\n everyone who has left houses  brothers  sisters  father  mother  children  or farms to follow me will get much more than they left . \\n and they will have eternal life . \\n many people who are first now will be last in the future . \\n and many who are last now will be first in the future . \\n then E1293 said  `` believe me when i say that some of you people standing here will see god \\'s kingdom come with power before you die . \\'\\' \\n six days later  E1293 took E3520  E2691  and E719 and went up on a high mountain . \\n they were all alone there . \\n while these followers watched [him]  E1293 was changed . \\n [his] clothes became shining white -- whiter than anyone on earth could make them . \\n then two men were there talking with E1293 . \\n they were E2279 and E5222 . \\n E3520 said to E1293  `` teacher  it is good that we are here . \\n we will put three tents here -- one for you  one for E5222  and one for E2279 . \\'\\' \\n E3520 did not know what to say  because [he] and the other two followers were so afraid . \\n then a cloud came and covered them . \\n a voice came from the cloud and said  `` this is my E5875  the one i love . \\n obey [him] ! \\'\\' \\n the followers looked  but they saw only E1293 there alone with them . \\n as E1293 and the followers were walking back down the mountain  [he] gave them these instructions : `` do n\\'t tell anyone about what you saw on the mountain . \\n E687 until after the E5875 of man rises from death . \\n then you can tell people what you saw . \\'\\' \\n so the followers waited to say anything about what they saw . \\n but they discussed among themselves what E1293 meant about rising from death . \\n they asked [him]  `` why do the teachers of the law say that E2279 must come first ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` they are right to say that E2279 must come first . \\n E2279 makes all things the way they should be . \\n but why do the scriptures say that the E5875 of man will suffer much and that people will think [he] is worth nothing ? \\n i tell you that E2279 has already come . \\n and people did to [him] all the bad things they wanted to do . \\n the scriptures said this would happen to [him] . \\'\\' \\n then E1293  E3520  E2691  and E719 went to the other followers . \\n they saw many people around them . \\n the teachers of the law were arguing with the followers . \\n when the people saw E1293  they were very surprised and ran to welcome [him] . \\n E1293 asked  `` what are you arguing about with the teachers of the law ? \\'\\' \\n a man answered  `` teacher  i brought my son to you . \\n [he] is controlled by an evil spirit that keeps [him] from talking . \\n the spirit attacks [him] and throws [him] on the ground . \\n [he] foams at the mouth  grinds [his] teeth  and becomes very stiff . \\n i asked your followers to force the evil spirit out  but they could not . \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` you people today do n\\'t believe ! \\n how long must i stay with you ? \\n how long must i be patient with you ? \\n bring the boy to me ! \\'\\' \\n so the followers brought the boy to E1293 . \\n when the evil spirit saw E1293  it attacked the boy . \\n the boy fell down and rolled on the ground . \\n [he] was foaming at the mouth . \\n E1293 asked the boy \\'s father  `` how long has this been happening to [him] ? \\'\\' \\n the father answered  `` since [he] was very young . \\n the spirit often throws [him] into a fire or into water to kill [him] . \\n if you can do anything  please have pity on us and help us . \\'\\' \\n E1293 said to the father  `` why did you say \\' if you can \\' ? \\n all things are possible for the one who believes . \\'\\' \\n immediately the father shouted  `` i do believe . \\n help me to believe more ! \\'\\' \\n E1293 saw that all the people were running there to see what was happening . \\n so [he] spoke to the evil spirit . \\n [he] said  `` you evil spirit that makes this boy deaf and stops [him] from talking -- i command you to come out of [him] and never enter [him] again ! \\'\\' \\n the evil spirit screamed . \\n it caused the boy to fall on the ground again  and then it came out . \\n the boy looked as if [he] was dead . \\n many people said  `` [he] is dead ! \\'\\' \\n but E1293 took hold of [his] hand and helped [him] stand up . \\n then E1293 went into the house . \\n [his] followers were alone with [him] there . \\n they said  `` why were n\\'t we able to force that evil spirit out ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` that kind of spirit can be forced out only with prayer . \\'\\' \\n then E1293 and [his] followers left there and went through galilee . \\n E1293 did not want the people to know where they were . \\n [he] wanted to teach [his] followers alone . \\n [he] said to them  `` the E5875 of man will be handed over to the control of other men  who will kill [him] . \\n after three days  [he] will rise from death . \\'\\' \\n but the followers did not understand what [he] meant  and they were afraid to ask [him] . \\n E1293 and [his] followers went to capernaum . \\n they went into a house  and E1293 said to them  `` i heard you arguing on the way here today . \\n what were you arguing about ? \\'\\' \\n but the followers did not answer  because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest . \\n E1293 sat down and called the twelve apostles to [him] . \\n [he] said  `` whoever wants to be the most important must make others more important than themselves . \\n they must serve everyone else . \\'\\' \\n then E1293 took a small child and stood the child in front of the followers . \\n [he] held the child in [his] arms and said  `` whoever accepts children like these in my name is accepting me . \\n and anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . \\'\\' \\n then E719 said  `` teacher  we saw a man using your name to force demons out of someone . \\n [he] is not one of us . \\n so we told [him] to stop  because [he] does not belong to our group . \\'\\' \\n E1293 said  `` do n\\'t stop [him] . \\n whoever uses my name to do powerful things will not soon say bad things about me . \\n whoever is not against us is with us . \\n i can assure you that anyone who helps you by giving you a drink of water because you belong to the E2839 will definitely get a reward . \\n `` if one of these little children believes in me  and someone causes that child to sin  it will be very bad for that person . \\n it would be better for them to have a millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the sea . \\n if your hand makes you sin  cut it off . \\n it is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two hands and go to hell . \\n there the fire never stops . \\n if your foot makes you sin  cut it off . \\n it is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two feet and be thrown into hell . \\n if your eye makes you sin  take it out . \\n it is better for you to have only one eye and enter god \\'s kingdom than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell . \\n the worms that eat the people in hell never die . \\n the fire there is never stopped . \\n `` everyone will be salted with fire . \\n `` salt is good . \\n but if it loses its salty taste  you ca n\\'t make it good again . \\n so  do n\\'t lose that good quality of salt you have . \\n and live in peace with each other . \\'\\' \\n E1293 called [his] twelve apostles together . \\n [he] gave them power to heal sicknesses and power to force demons out of people . \\n [he] sent them to tell about god \\'s kingdom and to heal the sick . \\n [he] said to them  `` when you travel  do n\\'t take a walking stick . \\n also  do n\\'t carry a bag  food  or money . \\n take for your trip only the clothes you are wearing . \\n when you go into a house  stay there until it is time to leave . \\n if the people in the town will not welcome you  go outside the town and shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them . \\'\\' \\n so the apostles went out . \\n they traveled through all the towns . \\n they told the good news and healed people everywhere . \\n herod the ruler heard about all these things that were happening . \\n [he] was confused because some people said  `` E719 the baptizer has risen from death . \\'\\' \\n others said  `` E2279 has come to us . \\'\\' \\n and some others said  `` one of the prophets from long ago has risen from death . \\'\\' \\n herod said  `` i cut off E719 \\'s head . \\n so who is this man i hear these things about ? \\'\\' \\n herod continued trying to see E1293 . \\n when the apostles came back  they told E1293 what they had done on their trip . \\n then [he] took them away to a town called bethsaida . \\n there  [he] and [his] apostles could be alone together . \\n but the people learned where E1293 went and followed [him] . \\n [he] welcomed them and talked with them about god \\'s kingdom . \\n [he] healed the people who were sick . \\n late in the afternoon  the twelve apostles came to E1293 and said  `` no one lives in this place . \\n send the people away . \\n they need to find food and places to sleep in the farms and towns around here . \\'\\' \\n but E1293 said to the apostles  `` you give them something to eat . \\'\\' \\n they said  `` we have only five loaves of bread and two fish . \\n do you want us to go buy food for all these people ? \\'\\' \\n there are too many ! \\n -lrb- there were about 5000 men there . -rrb- \\n E1293 said to [his] followers  `` tell the people to sit in groups of about 50 people . \\'\\' \\n so the followers did this and everyone sat down . \\n then E1293 took the five loaves of bread and two fish . \\n [he] looked up into the sky and thanked god for the food . \\n then [he] broke it into pieces  which [he] gave to the followers to give to the people . \\n they all ate until they were full . \\n and there was a lot of food left . \\n twelve baskets were filled with the pieces of food that were not eaten . \\n one time E1293 was praying alone . \\n [his] followers came together there  and [he] asked them  `` who do the people say i am ? \\'\\' \\n they answered  `` some people say you are E719 the baptizer . \\n others say you are E2279 . \\n and some people say you are one of the prophets from long ago that has come back to life . \\'\\' \\n then E1293 said to [his] followers  `` and who do you say i am ? \\'\\' \\n E3520 answered  `` you are the E2839 from god . \\'\\' \\n E1293 warned them not to tell anyone . \\n then E1293 said  `` the E5875 of man must suffer many things . \\n [he] will be rejected by the older jewish leaders  the leading priests  and teachers of the law . \\n and [he] will be killed . \\n but after three days [he] will be raised from death . \\'\\' \\n E1293 continued to say to all of them  `` any of you who want to be my follower must stop thinking about yourself and what you want . \\n you must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you every day for following me . \\n any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it . \\n but you who give up your life for me will save it . \\n it is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost . \\n do n\\'t be ashamed of me and my teaching . \\n if that happens  i will be ashamed of you when i come with my divine greatness and that of the father and the holy angels . \\n believe me when i say that some of you people standing here will see god \\'s kingdom before you die . \\'\\' \\n about eight days after E1293 said these things  [he] took E3520  E719  and E2691 and went up on a mountain to pray . \\n while E1293 was praying  [his] face began to change . \\n [his] clothes became shining white . \\n then two men were there  talking with [him] . \\n they were E5222 and E2279 . \\n they also looked bright and glorious . \\n they were talking with E1293 about [his] death that would happen in jerusalem . \\n E3520 and the others were asleep . \\n but they woke up and saw the glory of E1293 . \\n they also saw the two men who were standing with [him] . \\n when E5222 and E2279 were leaving  E3520 said  `` \\n master  it is good that we are here . \\n we will put three tents here -- one for you  one for E5222  and one for E2279 . \\'\\' \\n -lrb- [he] did not know what [he] was saying . -rrb- \\n while E3520 was saying these things  a cloud came all around them . \\n E3520  E719  and E2691 were afraid when the cloud covered them . \\n a voice came from the cloud and said  `` this is my E5875 . \\n [he] is the one i have chosen . \\n obey [him] . \\'\\' \\n when the voice stopped  only E1293 was there . \\n E3520  E719  and E2691 said nothing . \\n and for a long time after that  they told no one about what they had seen . \\n the next day  E1293  E3520  E719  and E2691 came down from the mountain . \\n a large group of people met E1293 . \\n a man in the group shouted to [him]  `` teacher  please come and look at my son . \\n [he] is the only child i have . \\n an evil spirit comes into [him]  and then [he] shouts . \\n [he] loses control of himself and foams at the mouth . \\n the evil spirit continues to hurt [him] and almost never leaves [him] . \\n i begged your followers to make the evil spirit leave my son  but they could not do it . \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` you people today have no faith . \\n your lives are all wrong . \\n how long must i be with you and be patient with you ? \\'\\' \\n then E1293 said to the man  `` bring your son here . \\'\\' \\n while the boy was coming  the demon threw the boy to the ground . \\n the boy lost control of himself . \\n but E1293 gave a strong command to the evil spirit . \\n then the boy was healed  and E1293 gave [him] back to [his] father . \\n all the people were amazed at the great power of god . \\n the people were still amazed about all the things E1293 did . \\n [he] said to [his] followers  `` do n\\'t forget what i will tell you now : the E5875 of man will soon be handed over to the control of other men . \\'\\' \\n but the followers did not understand what [he] meant . \\n the meaning was hidden from them so that they could not understand it . \\n but they were afraid to ask E1293 about what [he] said . \\n E1293 \\' followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest . \\n E1293 knew what they were thinking  so [he] took a little child and stood the child beside [him] . \\n then [he] said to the followers  `` whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me . \\n and anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . \\n the one among you who is the most humble -- this is the one who is great . \\'\\' \\n E719 answered  `` master  we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people . \\n we told [him] to stop because [he] does not belong to our group . \\'\\' \\n E1293 said to [him]  `` do n\\'t stop [him] . \\n whoever is not against you is for you . \\'\\' \\n the time was coming near when E1293 would leave and go back to heaven . \\n [he] decided to go to jerusalem . \\n [he] sent some men ahead of [him] . \\n they went into a town in E3752 to make everything ready for [him] . \\n but the people there would not welcome E1293 because [he] was going toward jerusalem . \\n E2691 and E719  the followers of E1293  saw this . \\n they said  `` lord  do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people ? \\'\\' \\n but E1293 turned and criticized them for saying this . \\n then [he] and [his] followers went to another town . \\n they were all traveling along the road . \\n someone said to E1293  `` i will follow you anywhere you go . \\'\\' \\n [he] answered  `` the foxes have holes to live in . \\n the birds have nests . \\n but the E5875 of man has no place where [he] can rest [his] head . \\'\\' \\n E1293 said to another man  `` follow me ! \\'\\' \\n but the man said  `` lord  let me go and bury my father first . \\'\\' \\n but E1293 said to [him]  `` let the people who are dead bury their own dead . \\n you must go and tell about god \\'s kingdom . \\'\\' \\n another man said  `` i will follow you  lord  but first let me go and say goodbye to my family . \\'\\' \\n E1293 said  `` anyone who begins to plow a field but looks back is not prepared for god \\'s kingdom . \\'\\' \\n E1293 was going through the city of jericho . \\n in jericho there was a man named zacchaeus . \\n [he] was a wealthy  very important tax collector . \\n [he] wanted to see who E1293 was . \\n there were many others who wanted to see E1293 too . \\n zacchaeus was too short to see above the people . \\n so [he] ran to a place where [he] knew E1293 would come . \\n then [he] climbed a sycamore tree so [he] could see [him] . \\n when E1293 came to where zacchaeus was  [he] looked up and saw [him] in the tree . \\n E1293 said  `` zacchaeus  hurry ! \\n come down ! \\n i must stay at your house today . \\'\\' \\n zacchaeus hurried and came down . \\n [he] was happy to have E1293 in [his] house . \\n everyone saw this . \\n they began to complain  `` look at the kind of man E1293 is staying with . \\n zacchaeus is a sinner ! \\'\\' \\n zacchaeus said to the lord  `` i want to do good . \\n i will give half of my money to the poor . \\n if i have cheated anyone  i will pay them back four times more . \\'\\' \\n E1293 said  `` today is the day for this family to be saved from sin . \\n yes  even this tax collector is one of god \\'s chosen people . \\n the E5875 of man came to find lost people and save them . \\'\\' \\n as the crowd listened to what [he] was saying  E1293 went on to tell a story . \\n [he] was now near jerusalem and knew that the people thought it was almost time for god \\'s kingdom to come . \\n so [he] said  `` a very important man was preparing to go to a country far away to be made a king . \\n then [he] planned to return home and rule [his] people . \\n so [he] called ten of [his] servants together . \\n [he] gave a bag of money to each servant . \\n [he] said  \\' do business with this money until i come back . \\' \\n but the people in the kingdom hated the man . \\n they sent a group to follow [him] to the other country . \\n there they said  \\' we do n\\'t want this man to be our king . \\' \\n `` but the man was made king . \\n when [he] came home  [he] said  \\' call those servants who have my money . \\n i want to know how much more money they earned with it . \\' \\n the first servant came and said  \\' sir  i earned ten bags of money with the one bag you gave me . \\' \\n the king said to [him]  \\' that \\'s great ! \\n you are a good servant . \\n i see that i can trust you with small things . \\n so now i will let you rule over ten of my cities . \\' \\n `` the second servant said  \\' sir  with your one bag of money i earned five bags . \\' \\n the king said to this servant  \\' you can rule over five cities . \\' \\n `` then another servant came in and said to the king  \\' sir  here is your bag of money . \\n i wrapped it in a piece of cloth and hid it . \\n i was afraid of you because you are a hard man . \\n you even take money that you did n\\'t earn and gather food that you did n\\'t grow . \\' \\n `` then the king said to [him]  \\' what a bad servant you are ! \\n i will use your own words to condemn you . \\n you said that i am a hard man . \\n you said that i even take money that i did n\\'t earn and gather food that i did n\\'t grow . \\n if that is true  you should have put my money in the bank . \\n then  when i came back  my money would have earned some interest . \\' \\n then the king said to the men who were watching  \\' take the bag of money away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten bags of money . \\' \\n `` the men said to the king  \\' but sir  that servant already has ten bags of money . \\' \\n `` the king said  \\' people who use what they have will get more . \\n but those who do not use what they have will have everything taken away from them . \\n now where are my enemies ? \\n where are the people who did not want me to be king ? \\n bring my enemies here and kill them . \\n i will watch them die . \\' \\'\\' \\n after E1293 said these things  [he] continued traveling toward jerusalem . \\n [he] came near bethphage and E4663  towns near the hill called the mount of olives . \\n [he] sent out two of [his] followers . \\n [he] said  `` go into the town you can see there . \\n when you enter the town  you will find a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden . \\n untie it  and bring it here to me . \\n if anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey  you should say  \\' the master needs it . \\' \\'\\' \\n the two followers went into town . \\n they found the donkey exactly like E1293 told them . \\n they untied it  but its owners came out . \\n they said to the followers  `` why are you untying our donkey ? \\'\\' \\n the followers answered  `` the master needs it . \\'\\' \\n so the followers brought the donkey to E1293 . \\n they put their coats on its back . \\n then they put E1293 on the donkey . \\n [he] rode along the road toward jerusalem . \\n the followers spread their coats on the road before [him] . \\n E1293 was coming close to jerusalem . \\n [he] was already near the bottom of the mount of olives . \\n the whole group of followers was happy . \\n they were very excited and praised god . \\n they thanked god for all the powerful things they had seen . \\n they said  `` \\' welcome ! \\n god bless the king who comes in the name of the lord . \\' \\n peace in heaven and glory to god ! \\'\\' \\n some of the pharisees said to E1293  `` teacher  tell your followers not to say these things . \\'\\' \\n but E1293 answered  `` i tell you  if my followers did n\\'t say them  these stones would shout them . \\'\\' \\n E1293 came near jerusalem . \\n looking at the city  [he] began to cry for it and said  `` i wish you knew today what would bring you peace . \\n but it is hidden from you now . \\n a time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and hold you in on all sides . \\n they will destroy you and all your people . \\n not one stone of your buildings will stay on top of another . \\n all this will happen because you did not know the time when god came to save you . \\'\\' \\n E1293 went into the E4971 area . \\n [he] began to throw out the people who were selling things there . \\n [he] said  `` the scriptures say  \\' my E4971 will be a house of prayer . \\' \\n but you have changed it into a \\' hiding place for thieves . \\' \\'\\' \\n E1293 taught the people in the E4971 area every day . \\n the leading priests  the teachers of the law  and some of the leaders of the people wanted to kill [him] . \\n but they did not know how they could do it  because everyone was listening to [him] . \\n the people were very interested in what E1293 said . \\n while E1293 was walking  [he] saw a man who had been blind since the time [he] was born . \\n E1293 \\' followers asked [him]  `` teacher  why was this man born blind ? \\n whose sin made it happen ? \\n was it [his] own sin or that of [his] parents ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` it was not any sin of this man or [his] parents that caused [him] to be blind . \\n [he] was born blind so that [he] could be used to show what great things god can do . \\n while it is daytime  we must continue doing the work of the one who sent me . \\n the night is coming  and no one can work at night . \\n while i am in the world  i am the light of the world . \\'\\' \\n after E1293 said this  [he] spit on the dirt  made some mud and put it on the man \\'s eyes . \\n E1293 told [him]  `` go and wash in siloam pool . \\'\\' \\n -lrb- siloam means `` sent . \\'\\' -rrb- \\n so the man went to the pool  washed and came back . \\n [he] was now able to see . \\n [his] neighbors and some others who had seen [him] begging said  `` look ! \\n is this the same man who always sits and begs ? \\'\\' \\n some people said  `` yes ! \\n [he] is the one . \\'\\' \\n but others said  `` no  [he] ca n\\'t be the same man . \\n [he] only looks like [him] . \\'\\' \\n so the man himself said  `` i am that same man . \\'\\' \\n they asked  `` what happened ? \\n how did you get your sight ? \\'\\' \\n [he] answered  `` the man they call E1293 made some mud and put it on my eyes . \\n then [he] told me to go to siloam and wash . \\n so i went there and washed . \\n and then i could see . \\'\\' \\n they asked [him]  `` where is this man ? \\'\\' \\n [he] answered  `` i do n\\'t know . \\'\\' \\n then the people brought the man to the pharisees . \\n the day E1293 had made mud and healed the man \\'s eyes was a sabbath day . \\n so the pharisees asked the man  `` how did you get your sight ? \\'\\' \\n [he] answered  `` [he] put mud on my eyes . \\n i washed  and now i can see . \\'\\' \\n some of the pharisees said  `` that man does not obey the law about the sabbath day . \\n so [he] is not from god . \\'\\' \\n others said  `` but someone who is a sinner can not do these miraculous signs . \\'\\' \\n so they could not agree with each other . \\n they asked the man again  `` since it was your eyes [he] healed  what do you say about [him] ? \\'\\' \\n [he] answered  `` [he] is a prophet . \\'\\' \\n the jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man -- that [he] was blind and was now healed . \\n but later they sent for [his] parents . \\n they asked them  `` is this your son ? \\n you say [he] was born blind . \\n so how can [he] see ? \\'\\' \\n [his] parents answered  `` we know that this man is our son . \\n and we know that [he] was born blind . \\n but we do n\\'t know why [he] can see now . \\n we do n\\'t know who healed [his] eyes . \\n ask [him] . \\n [he] is old enough to answer for himself . \\'\\' \\n they said this because they were afraid of the jewish leaders . \\n the leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said E1293 was the E2839 . \\n they would stop them from coming to the synagogue . \\n that is why [his] parents said  `` [he] is old enough . \\n ask [him] . \\'\\' \\n so the jewish leaders called the man who had been blind . \\n they told [him] to come in again . \\n they said  `` you should honor god by telling the truth . \\n we know that this man is a sinner . \\'\\' \\n the man answered  `` i do n\\'t know if [he] is a sinner . \\n but i do know this : i was blind  and now i can see . \\'\\' \\n they asked  `` what did [he] do to you ? \\n how did [he] heal your eyes ? \\'\\' \\n [he] answered  `` i have already told you that . \\n but you would not listen to me . \\n why do you want to hear it again ? \\n do you want to be [his] followers too ? \\'\\' \\n at this they shouted insults at [him] and said  `` you are [his] follower  not us ! \\n we are followers of E5222 . \\n we know that god spoke to E5222 . \\n but we do n\\'t even know where this man comes from ! \\'\\' \\n the man answered  `` this is really strange ! \\n you do n\\'t know where [he] comes from  but [he] healed my eyes . \\n we all know that god does not listen to sinners  but [he] will listen to anyone who worships and obeys [him] . \\n this is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind . \\n this man must be from god . \\n if [he] were not from god  [he] could not do anything like this . \\'\\' \\n the jewish leaders answered  `` you were born full of sin ! \\n are you trying to teach us ? \\'\\' \\n and they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out . \\n when E1293 heard that they had forced the man to leave  [he] found [him] and asked [him]  `` do you believe in the E5875 of man ? \\'\\' \\n the man said  `` tell me who [he] is  sir  so i can believe in [him] . \\'\\' \\n E1293 said to [him]  `` you have already seen [him] . \\n the E5875 of man is the one talking with you now . \\'\\' \\n the man answered  `` yes  i believe  lord ! \\'\\' \\n then [he] bowed and worshiped E1293 . \\n E1293 said  `` i came into this world so that the world could be judged . \\n i came so that people who are blind could see . \\n and i came so that people who think they see would become blind . \\'\\' \\n some of the pharisees were near E1293 . \\n they heard [him] say this . \\n they asked  `` what ? \\n are you saying that we are blind too ? \\'\\' \\n E1293 said  `` if you were really blind  you would not be guilty of sin . \\n but you say that you see  so you are still guilty . \\'\\' \\n then pilate ordered that E1293 be taken away and whipped . \\n the soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on [his] head . \\n then they put a purple robe around [him] . \\n they kept coming up to [him] and saying  `` hail to the king of the jews ! \\'\\' \\n and they hit [him] in the face . \\n again pilate came out and said to the jewish leaders  `` look ! \\n i am bringing E1293 out to you . \\n i want you to know that i find nothing i can charge [him] with . \\'\\' \\n then E1293 came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . \\n pilate said to the jews  `` here is the man ! \\'\\' \\n when the leading priests and the jewish guards saw E1293 they shouted  `` kill [him] on a cross ! \\n kill [him] on a cross ! \\'\\' \\n but pilate answered  `` you take [him] and nail [him] to a cross yourselves . \\n i find nothing i can charge [him] with . \\'\\' \\n the jewish leaders answered  `` we have a law that says [he] must die  because [he] said [he] is the E5875 of god . \\'\\' \\n when pilate heard this  [he] was more afraid . \\n so [he] went back inside the palace and asked E1293  `` where are you from ? \\'\\' \\n but E1293 did not answer [him] . \\n pilate said  `` you refuse to speak to me ? \\n remember  i have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross . \\'\\' \\n E1293 answered  `` the only power you have over me is the power given to you by god . \\n so the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin . \\'\\' \\n after this  pilate tried to let E1293 go free . \\n but the jewish leaders shouted  `` anyone who makes himself a king is against E3269 . \\n so if you let this man go free  that means you are not E3269 \\'s friend . \\'\\' \\n when pilate heard this  [he] brought E1293 out to the place called `` the stone pavement . \\'\\' \\n -lrb- in aramaic the name is gabbatha . -rrb- \\n pilate sat down on the judge \\'s seat there . \\n it was now almost noon on preparation day of passover week . \\n pilate said to the jews  `` here is your king ! \\'\\' \\n they shouted  `` take [him] away ! \\n take [him] away ! \\n kill [him] on a cross ! \\'\\' \\n pilate asked them  `` do you want me to kill your king on a cross ? \\'\\' \\n the leading priests answered  `` the only king we have is E3269 ! \\'\\' \\n so pilate handed E1293 over to them to be killed on a cross . \\n the soldiers took E1293 . \\n [he] carried [his] own cross to a place called `` the place of the skull . \\'\\' \\n -lrb- in aramaic the name of this place is `` golgotha . \\'\\' -rrb- \\n there they nailed E1293 to the cross . \\n they also nailed two other men to crosses . \\n they put them on each side of E1293 with [him] in the middle . \\n pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross . \\n the sign said  `` jesus of nazareth  the king of the jews . \\'\\' \\n the sign was written in aramaic  in latin  and in greek . \\n many of the jews read this sign  because the place where E1293 was nailed to the cross was near the city . \\n the leading jewish priests said to pilate  `` do n\\'t write  \\' the E6623 of the jews . \\' \\n but write  \\' this man said  i am the E6623 of the jews . \\' \\'\\' \\n pilate answered  `` i will not change what i have written . \\'\\' \\n after the soldiers nailed E1293 to the cross  they took [his] clothes and divided them into four parts . \\n each soldier got one part . \\n they also took [his] tunic . \\n it was all one piece of cloth woven from top to bottom . \\n so the soldiers said to each other  `` we should not tear this into parts . \\n let \\'s throw lots to see who will get it . \\'\\' \\n this happened to make clear the full meaning of what the scriptures say : `` they divided my clothes among them  and they threw lots for what i was wearing . \\'\\' \\n so the soldiers did this . \\n E1293 \\' mother stood near [his] cross . \\n [her] sister was also standing there with E4226 the wife of clopas  and E4226 E3191 . \\n E1293 saw [his] mother . \\n [he] also saw the follower [he] loved very much standing there . \\n [he] said to [his] mother  `` dear woman  here is your son . \\'\\' \\n then [he] said to the follower  `` here is your mother . \\'\\' \\n so after that  this follower took E1293 \\' mother to live in [his] home . \\n later  E1293 knew that everything had been done . \\n to make the scriptures come true [he] said  `` i am thirsty . \\'\\' \\n there was a jar full of sour wine there  so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it . \\n they put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant and lifted it to E1293 \\' mouth . \\n when [he] tasted the wine  [he] said  `` it is finished . \\'\\' \\n then [he] bowed [his] head and died . \\n this day was preparation day . \\n the next day was a special sabbath day . \\n the jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the sabbath day . \\n so they asked pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken . \\n and they asked that the bodies be taken down from the crosses . \\n so the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men on the crosses beside E1293 . \\n but when the soldiers came close to E1293  they saw that [he] was already dead . \\n so they did not break [his] legs . \\n but one of the soldiers stuck [his] spear into E1293 \\' \\n side . \\n immediately blood and water came out . \\n -lrb- the one who saw this happen has told about it . \\n [he] told about it so that you also can believe . \\n the things [he] says are true . \\n [he] knows that [he] tells the truth . -rrb- \\n these things happened to give full meaning to the scriptures that said  `` none of [his] bones will be broken \\'\\' \\n and `` people will look at the one they stabbed . \\'\\' \\n later  a man named E6315 from arimathea asked pilate for the body of E1293 . \\n -lrb- E6315 was a follower of E1293  but [he] did not tell anyone  because [he] was afraid of the jewish leaders . -rrb- \\n pilate said E6315 could take E1293 \\' body  so [he] came and took it away . \\n nicodemus went with E6315 . \\n [he] was the man who had come to E1293 before and talked to [him] at night . \\n [he] brought about 100 pounds of spices -- a mixture of myrrh and aloes . \\n these two men took E1293 \\' body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices . \\n -lrb- this is how the jews bury people . -rrb- \\n in the place where E1293 was killed on the cross  there was a garden . \\n in the garden there was a new tomb . \\n no one had ever been buried there before . \\n the men put E1293 in that tomb because it was near  and the jews were preparing to start their sabbath day . \\n in jerusalem E7537 was still trying to scare the followers of the lord  even saying [he] would kill them . \\n [he] went to the high priest and asked [him] to write letters to the synagogues in the city of damascus . \\n E7537 wanted the high priest to give [him] the authority to find people in damascus who were followers of the E2698 . \\n if [he] found any believers there  men or women  [he] would arrest them and bring them back to jerusalem . \\n so E7537 went to damascus . \\n when [he] came near the city  a very bright light from heaven suddenly shined around [him] . \\n [he] fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to [him]  `` E7537  E7537 ! \\n why are you persecuting me ? \\'\\' \\n E7537 said  `` who are you  lord ? \\'\\' \\n the voice answered  `` i am E1293  the one you are persecuting . \\n get up now and go into the city . \\n someone there will tell you what you must do . \\'\\' \\n the men traveling with E7537 just stood there  unable to speak . \\n they heard the voice  but they saw no one . \\n E7537 got up from the ground and opened [his] eyes  but [he] could not see . \\n so the men with [him] held [his] hand and led [him] into damascus . \\n for three days E7537 could not see ; [he] did not eat or drink . \\n there was a follower of E1293 in damascus named ananias . \\n in a vision the lord said to [him]  `` ananias ! \\'\\' \\n ananias answered  `` here i am  lord . \\'\\' \\n the lord said to [him]  `` get up and go to the street called straight street . \\n find the house of E474 and ask for a man named E7537 from the city of tarsus . \\n [he] is there now  praying . \\n [he] has seen a vision in which a man named ananias came and laid [his] hands on [him] so that [he] could see again . \\'\\' \\n but ananias answered  `` lord  many people have told me about this man . \\n they told me about the many bad things [he] did to your holy people in jerusalem . \\n now [he] has come here to damascus . \\n the leading priests have given [him] the power to arrest all people who trust in you . \\'\\' \\n but the lord E1293 said to ananias  `` go ! \\n i have chosen E7537 for an important work . \\n [he] must tell about me to other nations and their rulers and to the people of E7074 . \\n i will show [him] all that [he] must suffer for me . \\'\\' \\n so ananias left and went to the house of E474 . \\n [he] laid [his] hands on E7537 and said  `` E7537  my brother  the lord E1293 sent me . \\n [he] is the one you saw on the road when you came here . \\n [he] sent me so that you can see again and also be filled with the holy spirit . \\'\\' \\n immediately  something that looked like fish scales fell off E7537 \\'s eyes . \\n [he] was able to see ! \\n then [he] got up and was baptized . \\n after [he] ate  [he] began to feel strong again . \\n E7537 stayed with the followers of E1293 in damascus for a few days . \\n soon [he] began to go to the synagogues and tell people about E1293 . \\n [he] told the people  `` E1293 is the E5875 of god ! \\'\\' \\n all the people who heard E7537 were amazed . \\n they said  `` this is the same man who was in jerusalem trying to destroy the people who trust in E1293 ! \\n and that \\'s why [he] has come here -- to arrest the followers of E1293 and take them back to the leading priests . \\'\\' \\n but E7537 became more and more powerful in proving that E1293 is the E2839 . \\n [his] proofs were so strong that the jews who lived in damascus could not argue with [him] . \\n after many days  some jews made plans to kill E7537 . \\n they were watching the city gates day and night . \\n they wanted to kill E7537  but [he] learned about their plan . \\n one night some followers that E7537 had taught helped [him] leave the city . \\n they put [him] in a basket and lowered it down through a hole in the city wall . \\n then E7537 went to jerusalem . \\n [he] tried to join the group of followers  but they were all afraid of [him] . \\n they did not believe that [he] was really a follower of E1293 . \\n but E5120 accepted E7537 and took [him] to the apostles . \\n [he] told them how E7537 had seen the lord on the road and how the lord had spoken to E7537 . \\n then [he] told them how boldly E7537 had spoken for the lord in damascus . \\n and so E7537 stayed with the followers and went all around jerusalem speaking boldly for the lord . \\n [he] often had arguments with the greek - speaking jews  who began making plans to kill [him] . \\n when the believers learned about this  they took E7537 to caesarea  and from there they sent [him] to the city of tarsus . \\n the church in judea  galilee  and E3752 had a time of peace . \\n with the help of the holy spirit  the groups of believers became stronger and showed their respect for the lord by the way they lived . \\n so the church everywhere grew in numbers . \\n E3520 was traveling through all the areas around jerusalem  and [he] stopped to visit the believers who lived in lydda . \\n there [he] met a man named aeneas  who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for the past eight years . \\n E3520 said to [him]  `` aeneas  E1293 E2839 heals you . \\n get up and make your bed ! \\'\\' \\n [he] stood up immediately . \\n all the people living in lydda and on the plain of E2217 saw [him]  and they decided to follow the lord . \\n in the city of joppa there was a follower of E1293 named E3308 . \\n [her] greek name  E1185  means `` a deer . \\'\\' \\n [she] was always doing good things for people and giving money to those in need . \\n while E3520 was in lydda  E3308 became sick and died . \\n they washed [her] body and put it in an upstairs room . \\n the followers in joppa heard that E3520 was in lydda  which was not far away . \\n so they sent two men  who begged [him]  `` hurry  please come quickly ! \\'\\' \\n E3520 got ready and went with them . \\n when [he] arrived  they took [him] to the upstairs room . \\n all the widows stood around [him] . \\n they were crying and showing [him] the coats and other clothes that E3308 had made during [her] time with them . \\n E3520 sent all the people out of the room . \\n [he] knelt down and prayed . \\n then [he] turned to E3308 \\'s body and said  `` E3308  stand up ! \\'\\' \\n [she] opened [her] eyes . \\n when [she] saw E3520  [she] sat up . \\n [he] gave [her] [his] hand and helped [her] stand up . \\n then [he] called the believers and the widows into the room . \\n [he] showed them E3308 ; [she] was alive ! \\n people everywhere in joppa learned about this  and many believed in the lord . \\n E3520 stayed in joppa for many days at the home of a man named E564  who was a leatherworker . \\n while apollos was in the city of corinth  E2138 was visiting some places on [his] way to ephesus . \\n in ephesus [he] found some other followers of the lord . \\n [he] asked them  `` did you receive the holy spirit when you believed ? \\'\\' \\n these followers said to [him]  `` we have never even heard of a holy spirit ! \\'\\' \\n E2138 asked them  `` so what kind of baptism did you have ? \\'\\' \\n they said  `` it was the baptism that E719 taught . \\'\\' \\n E2138 said  `` E719 told people to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives . \\n [he] told people to believe in the one who would come after [him]  and that one is E1293 . \\'\\' \\n when these followers heard this  they were baptized in the name of the lord E1293 . \\n then E2138 laid [his] hands on them  and the holy spirit came on them . \\n they began speaking different languages and prophesying . \\n there were about twelve men in this group . \\n E2138 went into the synagogue and spoke very boldly . \\n [he] continued doing this for three months . \\n [he] talked with the jews  trying to persuade them to accept what [he] was telling them about god \\'s kingdom . \\n but some of them became stubborn and refused to believe . \\n in front of everyone  they said bad things about the E2698 . \\n so E2138 left these jews and took the lord \\'s followers with [him] . \\n [he] went to a place where a man named tyrannus had a school . \\n there E2138 talked with people every day . \\n [he] did this for two years . \\n because of this work  everyone in E3336  jews and greeks  heard the word of the lord . \\n god used E2138 to do some very special miracles . \\n some people carried away handkerchiefs and clothes that E2138 had used and put them on those who were sick . \\n the sick people were healed  and evil spirits left them . \\n some jews also were traveling around forcing evil spirits out of people . \\n the seven sons of sceva  one of the leading priests  were doing this . \\n these jews tried to use the name of the lord E1293 to make the evil spirits go out of people . \\n they all said  `` by the same E1293 that E2138 talks about  i order you to come out ! \\'\\' \\n but one time an evil spirit said to these jews  `` i know E1293  and i know about E2138  but who are you ? \\'\\' \\n then the man who had the evil spirit inside [him] jumped on these jews . \\n [he] was much stronger than all of them . \\n [he] beat them up and tore their clothes off . \\n they all ran away from that house . \\n all the people in ephesus  jews and greeks  learned about this . \\n they were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the lord E1293 . \\n many of the believers began to confess  telling about all the evil things they had done . \\n some of them had used magic . \\n these believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone . \\n these books were worth about 50  000 silver coins . \\n this is how the word of the lord was spreading in a powerful way  causing more and more people to believe . \\n after this  E2138 made plans to go to jerusalem . \\n [he] planned to go through the regions of macedonia and achaia  and then go to jerusalem . \\n [he] thought  `` after i visit jerusalem  i must also visit rome . \\'\\' \\n E5637 and E2927 were two of [his] helpers . \\n E2138 sent them ahead to macedonia . \\n but [he] stayed in E3336 for a while . \\n but during that time there was some trouble in ephesus about the E2698 . \\n this is how it all happened : there was a man named E4123 . \\n [he] worked with silver . \\n [he] made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess artemis . \\n the men who did this work made a lot of money . \\n E4123 had a meeting with these men and some others who did the same kind of work . \\n [he] told them  `` men  you know that we make a lot of money from our business . \\n but look at what this man E2138 is doing . \\n listen to what [he] is saying . \\n [he] has convinced many people in ephesus and all over E3336 to change their religion . \\n [he] says the gods that people make by hand are not real . \\n i \\'m afraid this is going to turn people against our business . \\n but there is also another problem . \\n people will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess artemis is not important . \\n [her] greatness will be destroyed . \\n and artemis is the goddess that everyone in E3336 and the whole world worships . \\'\\' \\n when the men heard this  they became very angry . \\n they shouted  `` great is artemis  the goddess of ephesus ! \\'\\' \\n the whole city was thrown into confusion . \\n the people grabbed gaius and aristarchus  men from macedonia who were traveling with E2138  and rushed all together into the stadium . \\n E2138 wanted to go in and talk to the people  but the lord \\'s followers did not let [him] go . \\n also  some leaders of the country who were friends of E2138 sent [him] a message telling [him] not to go into the stadium . \\n some people were shouting one thing and others were shouting something else . \\n the meeting was very confused . \\n most of the people did not know why they had come there . \\n some jews made a man named E2734 stand before the crowd  and they told [him] what to say . \\n E2734 waved [his] hand  trying to explain things to the people . \\n but when the people saw that E2734 was a jew  they all began shouting the same thing . \\n for two hours they continued shouting  `` great is artemis of ephesus ! \\n great is artemis of ephesus ! \\n great is artemis . . . ! \\'\\' \\n then the city clerk persuaded the people to be quiet . \\n [he] said  `` men of ephesus  everyone knows that ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess artemis . \\n everyone knows that we also keep [her] holy rock . \\n no one can deny this  so you should be quiet . \\n you must stop and think before you do anything else . \\n `` you brought these men here  but they have not said anything bad against our goddess . \\n they have not stolen anything from [her] temple . \\n we have courts of law and there are judges . \\n do E4123 and those men who work with [him] have a charge against anyone ? \\n they should go to the courts . \\n let them argue with each other there . \\n `` is there something else you want to talk about ? \\n then come to the regular town meeting of the people . \\n it can be decided there . \\n i say this because someone might see this trouble today and say we are rioting . \\n we could not explain all this trouble  because there is no real reason for this meeting . \\'\\' \\n after the city clerk said this  [he] told the people to go home . \\n i am in E2839 and i am telling you the truth . \\n i am not lying . \\n and my conscience  ruled by the holy spirit  agrees that what i say now is true . \\n i have great sorrow and always feel much sadness for my own people . \\n they are my brothers and sisters  my earthly family . \\n i wish i could help them . \\n i would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from E2839 if that would help them . \\n they are the people of E7074  god \\'s chosen children . \\n they have the glory of god and the agreements [he] made between himself and [his] people . \\n god gave them the law of E5222  the E4971 worship  and [his] promises . \\n they are the descendants of our great fathers  and they are the earthly family of E2839 . \\n and E2839 is god over all things . \\n praise [him] forever ! \\n amen . \\n i do n\\'t mean that god failed to keep [his] promise to the jewish people . \\n but only some of the people of E7074 are really god \\'s people . \\n and only some of E6748 \\'s descendants are true children of E6748 . \\n this is what god said to E6748 : `` your true descendants will be those who come through E3372 . \\'\\' \\n this means that not all of E6748 \\'s descendants are god \\'s true children . \\n E6748 \\'s true children are those who become god \\'s children because of the promise [he] made to E6748 . \\n here is what god said in that promise : `` about this time next year i will come back  and E990 will have a son . \\'\\' \\n and that is not all . \\n E3594 also had sons  and they had the same father . \\n [he] is our father E3372 . \\n but before the two sons were born  god told E3594  `` the older son will serve the younger . \\'\\' \\n this was before the boys had done anything good or bad . \\n god said this before they were born so that the boy [he] wanted would be chosen because of god \\'s own plan . \\n [he] was chosen because [he] was the one god wanted to call  not because of anything the boys did . \\n as the scriptures say  `` i loved E5804  but i hated E4404 . \\'\\' \\n so what does this mean ? \\n that god is not fair ? \\n we can not say that . \\n god said to E5222  `` i will show mercy to anyone i want to show mercy to . \\n i will show pity to anyone i choose . \\'\\' \\n so god will choose anyone [he] decides to show mercy to  and [his] choice does not depend on what people want or try to do . \\n in the scriptures god says to pharaoh : `` i made you king so that you could do this for me . \\n i wanted to show my power through you . \\n i wanted my name to be announced throughout the world . \\'\\' \\n so god shows mercy to those [he] wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those [he] wants to make stubborn . \\n so one of you will ask me  `` if god controls what we do  why does [he] blame us for our sins ? \\'\\' \\n do n\\'t ask that . \\n you are only human and have no right to question god . \\n a clay jar does not question the one who made it . \\n it does not say  `` why did you make me like this ? \\'\\' \\n the one who makes the jar can make anything [he] wants . \\n [he] uses the same clay to make different things . \\n [he] might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use . \\n it is the same way with what god has done . \\n [he] wanted to show [his] anger and to let people see [his] power . \\n but [he] patiently endured those [he] was angry with -- people who were ready to be destroyed . \\n [he] waited with patience so that [he] could make known the riches of [his] glory to the people [he] has chosen to receive [his] mercy . \\n god has already prepared them to share [his] glory . \\n we are those people  the ones god chose not only from the jews but also from those who are not jews . \\n as the scriptures say in the book of hosea  `` the people who are not mine -- i will say they are my people . \\n and the people i did not love -- i will say they are the people i love . \\'\\' \\n and  `` where god said in the past  \\' you are not my people \\' -- there they will be called children of the living god . \\'\\' \\n and E6469 cries out about E7074 : `` there are so many people of E7074  they are like the grains of sand by the sea . \\n but only a few of them will be saved . \\n yes  the lord will quickly finish judging the people on the earth . \\'\\' \\n it is just as E6469 said : `` the lord all - powerful allowed some of our people to live . \\n if [he] had not done that  we would now be like sodom  and we would be like gomorrah . \\'\\' \\n so what does all this mean ? \\n it means that people who are not jews were made right with god because of their faith  even though they were not trying to make themselves right . \\n and the people of E7074  who tried to make themselves right with god by following the law  did not succeed . \\n they failed because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did . \\n they did not trust in god to make them right . \\n they fell over the stone that makes people fall . \\n the scriptures talk about that stone : `` look  i put in zion a stone that will make people stumble . \\n it is a rock that will make people fall . \\n but anyone who trusts in [him] will never be disappointed . \\'\\' \\n i am a free man . \\n i am an apostle . \\n i have seen E1293 our lord . \\n you people are an example of my work in the lord . \\n others may not accept me as an apostle  but surely you do . \\n you are proof that i am an apostle in the lord . \\n some people want to judge me . \\n so this is the answer i give them : we have the right to eat and drink  do n\\'t we ? \\n we have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel  do n\\'t we ? \\n the other apostles and the lord \\'s brothers and E3520 all do this . \\n and are E5120 and i the only ones who must work to earn our living ? \\n no soldier ever serves in the army and pays [his] own salary . \\n no one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself . \\n no one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself . \\n these are n\\'t just my own thoughts . \\n god \\'s law says the same thing . \\n yes  it is written in the law of E5222 : `` \\n when a work animal is being used to separate grain  do n\\'t keep it from eating the grain . \\'\\' \\n when god said this  was [he] thinking only about work animals ? \\n no . \\n [he] was really talking about us . \\n yes  that was written for us . \\n the one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work . \\n we planted spiritual seed among you  so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life . \\n surely that is not asking too much . \\n others have this right to get things from you . \\n so surely we have this right too . \\n but we do n\\'t use this right . \\n no  we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the good news of E2839 . \\n surely you know that those who work at the E4971 get their food from the E4971 . \\n and those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar . \\n it is the same with those who have the work of telling the good news . \\n the lord has commanded that those who tell the good news should get their living from this work . \\n but i have not used any of these rights  and i am not trying to get anything from you . \\n that is not my purpose for writing this . \\n i would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride . \\n it \\'s not my work of telling the good news that gives me any reason to boast . \\n that is my duty -- something i must do . \\n if i do n\\'t tell people the good news  i am in real trouble . \\n if i did it because it was my own choice  i would deserve to be paid . \\n but i have no choice . \\n i must tell the good news . \\n so i am only doing the duty that was given to me . \\n so what do i get for doing it ? \\n my reward is that when i tell people the good news i can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work . \\n i am free . \\n i belong to no other person  but i make myself a slave to everyone . \\n i do this to help save as many people as i can . \\n to the jews i became like a jew so that i could help save jews . \\n i myself am not ruled by the law  but to those who are ruled by the law i became like someone who is ruled by the law . \\n i did this to help save those who are ruled by the law . \\n to those who are without the law i became like someone who is without the law . \\n i did this to help save those who are without the law . \\n -lrb- but really  i am not without god \\'s law -- i am ruled by the law of E2839 . -rrb- \\n to those who are weak  i became weak so that i could help save them . \\n i have become all things to all people . \\n i did this so that i could save people in any way possible . \\n i do all this to make the good news known . \\n i do it so that i can share in the blessings of the good news . \\n you know that in a race all the runners run  but only one runner gets the prize . \\n so run like that . \\n run to win ! \\n all who compete in the games use strict training . \\n they do this so that they can win a prize -- one that does n\\'t last . \\n but our prize is one that will last forever . \\n so i run like someone who has a goal . \\n i fight like a boxer who is hitting something  not just the air . \\n it is my own body i fight to make it do what i want . \\n i do this so that i wo n\\'t miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it . \\n i really do n\\'t need to write to you about this help for god \\'s people . \\n i know that you want to help . \\n i have been bragging about you to the people in macedonia . \\n i told them that you people in achaia have been ready to give since last year . \\n and your desire to give has made most of the people here ready to give also . \\n but i am sending the brothers to you . \\n i do n\\'t want our bragging about you in this to be for nothing . \\n i want you to be ready just as i said you would be . \\n if any of those from macedonia come with me  and they find that you are not ready  we will be ashamed . \\n we will be ashamed that we were so sure of you . \\n and you will be ashamed too ! \\n so i thought that i should ask these brothers to come there before we do . \\n they will help in getting together the generous gift you promised . \\n then it will be ready when we come  and it will be seen as a blessing you are giving  not as something you were forced to do . \\n remember this : the one who plants few seeds will have a small harvest . \\n but the one who plants a lot will have a big harvest . \\n each one of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give . \\n you should not give if it makes you unhappy or if you feel forced to give . \\n god loves those who are happy to give . \\n and god can give you more blessings than you need  and you will always have plenty of everything . \\n you will have enough to give to every good work . \\n as the scriptures say  `` [he] gives generously to the poor ; [his] goodness will continue forever . \\'\\' \\n god is the one who gives seed to those who plant  and [he] gives bread for food . \\n and god will give you spiritual seed and make that seed grow . \\n [he] will produce a great harvest from your goodness . \\n god will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely . \\n and your giving through us will make people give thanks to god . \\n the service you are offering helps god \\'s people with their needs  but that is not all it does . \\n it is also bringing more and more thanks to god . \\n this service is a proof of your faith  and people will praise god because of it . \\n they will praise [him] because you are following the message about E2839 -- the message you say you believe . \\n they will praise god because you freely share with them and with all people . \\n and when they pray  they will wish they could be with you . \\n they will feel this way because of the great grace that god gave you . \\n thanks be to god for [his] gift that is too wonderful to describe . \\n the first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth . \\n this place was inside a tent . \\n the first area in the tent was called the holy place . \\n in the holy place were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to god . \\n behind the second curtain was a room called the most holy place . \\n in the most holy place was a golden altar for burning incense . \\n and also there was the box of the agreement . \\n the box was covered with gold . \\n inside this box was a golden jar of manna and E5035 \\'s rod -- the rod that once grew leaves . \\n also in the box were the flat stones with the ten commandments of the old agreement on them . \\n above the box were the cherub angels that showed god \\'s glory . \\n these cherub angels were over the place of mercy . \\n but we can not say everything about this now . \\n everything in the tent was made ready in the way i have explained . \\n then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties . \\n but only the high priest could go into the second room  and [he] went in only once a year . \\n also  [he] could never enter that room without taking blood with [him] . \\n [he] offered that blood to god for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinning . \\n the holy spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the most holy place was not open while the first room was still there . \\n this is an example for us today . \\n it shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to god are not able to make the consciences of the worshipers completely clear . \\n these gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings . \\n they are only rules about the body . \\n god gave them for [his] people to follow until the time of [his] new way . \\n but E2839 has already come to be the high priest . \\n [he] is the high priest of the good things we now have . \\n but E2839 does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in . \\n [he] serves in a better place . \\n unlike that tent  this one is perfect . \\n it was not made by anyone here on earth . \\n it does not belong to this world . \\n E2839 entered the most holy place only one time -- enough for all time . \\n [he] entered the most holy place by using [his] own blood  not the blood of goats or young bulls . \\n [he] entered there and made us free from sin forever . \\n the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship . \\n the blood and ashes made them pure again -- but only their bodies . \\n so surely the blood sacrifice of E2839 can do much more . \\n E2839 offered himself through the eternal spirit as a perfect sacrifice to god . \\n [his] blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done . \\n it will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living god . \\n so E2839 brings a new agreement from god to [his] people . \\n [he] brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by god can have the blessings god promised  blessings that last forever . \\n this can happen only because E2839 died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement . \\n when someone dies and leaves a will  there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead . \\n a will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living . \\n it can be used only after that person \\'s death . \\n that is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between god and [his] people . \\n first  E5222 told the people every command in the law . \\n then [he] took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water . \\n [he] used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people . \\n then [he] said  `` this is the blood that makes the agreement good -- the agreement that god commanded you to follow . \\'\\' \\n in the same way  E5222 sprinkled the blood on the holy tent . \\n [he] sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship . \\n the law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood . \\n sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice . \\n these things are copies of the real things that are in heaven . \\n these copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices . \\n but the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices . \\n E2839 went into the most holy place . \\n but it was not the man - made one  which is only a copy of the real one . \\n [he] went into heaven  and [he] is there now before god to help us . \\n the high priest enters the most holy place once every year . \\n [he] takes with [him] blood to offer . \\n but [he] does not offer [his] own blood like E2839 did . \\n E2839 went into heaven  but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again . \\n if E2839 had offered himself many times  [he] would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made . \\n but [he] came to offer himself only once . \\n and that once is enough for all time . \\n [he] came at a time when the world is nearing an end . \\n [he] came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice . \\n everyone must die once . \\n then they are judged . \\n so E2839 was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people . \\n and [he] will come a second time  but not to offer himself for sin . \\n [he] will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for [him] . \\n the fifth angel blew [his] trumpet . \\n then i saw a star fall from the sky to the earth . \\n the star was given the key to the deep hole that leads down to the bottomless pit . \\n then the star opened the hole leading to the pit . \\n smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace . \\n the sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole . \\n then locusts came out of the smoke and went down to the earth . \\n they were given the power to sting like scorpions . \\n they were told not to damage the fields of grass or any plant or tree . \\n they were to hurt only those who did not have god \\'s mark on their foreheads . \\n they were not given the power to kill them but only to cause them pain for five months -- pain like a person feels when stung by a scorpion . \\n during those days people will look for a way to die  but they will not find it . \\n they will want to die  but death will hide from them . \\n the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . \\n on their heads they wore something that looked like a gold crown . \\n their faces looked like human faces . \\n their hair was like women \\'s hair . \\n their teeth were like lions \\' teeth . \\n their chests looked like iron breastplates . \\n the sound their wings made was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle . \\n the locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions . \\n the power they had to give people pain for five months was in their tails . \\n they had a ruler  who was the angel of the bottomless pit . \\n [his] name in hebrew is abaddon . \\n in greek it is apollyon . \\n the first terror is now past . \\n there are still two other terrors to come . \\n the sixth angel blew [his] trumpet . \\n then i heard a voice coming from the horns on the four corners of the golden altar that is before god . \\n it said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet  `` free the four angels who are tied at the great river euphrates . \\'\\' \\n these four angels had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year . \\n the angels were set free to kill a third of all the people on the earth . \\n i heard how many troops on horses were in their army . \\n there were 200  000  000 . \\n in my vision  i saw the horses and the riders on the horses . \\n they looked like this : they had breastplates that were fiery red  dark blue  and yellow like sulfur . \\n the heads of the horses looked like heads of lions . \\n the horses had fire  smoke  and sulfur coming out of their mouths . \\n a third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues coming out of the horses \\' mouths : the fire  the smoke  and the sulfur . \\n the horses \\' power was in their mouths and also in their tails . \\n their tails were like snakes that have heads to bite and hurt people . \\n the other people on earth were not killed by these plagues . \\n but these people still did not change their hearts and turn away from worshiping the things they had made with their own hands . \\n they did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold  silver  bronze  stone  and wood -- things that can not see or hear or walk . \\n they did not change their hearts and turn away from killing other people or from their evil magic  their sexual sins  and their stealing . \\n after this i heard what sounded like a large crowd of people in heaven . \\n the people were saying  `` hallelujah ! \\n victory  glory  and power belong to our god . \\n [his] judgments are true and right . \\n our god has punished the prostitute . \\n [she] is the one who ruined the earth with [her] sexual sin . \\n god has punished the prostitute to pay [her] back for the death of [his] servants . \\'\\' \\n these people also said  `` hallelujah ! \\n [she] is burning and [her] smoke will rise forever and ever . \\'\\' \\n then the 24 elders and the four living beings bowed down . \\n they worshiped god  who sits on the throne . \\n they said  `` amen ! \\n hallelujah ! \\'\\' \\n then a voice came from the throne and said  `` praise our god  all you who serve [him] ! \\n praise our god  all you small and great who honor [him] ! \\'\\' \\n then i heard something that sounded like a large crowd of people . \\n it was as loud as crashing waves or claps of thunder . \\n the people were saying  `` hallelujah ! \\n our lord god rules . \\n [he] is the all - powerful . \\n let us rejoice and be happy and give god glory ! \\n give god glory  because the wedding of the E1600 has come . \\n and the E1600 \\'s bride has made herself ready . \\n fine linen was given to the bride for [her] to wear . \\n the linen was bright and clean . \\'\\' \\n -lrb- the fine linen means the good things that god \\'s holy people did . -rrb- \\n then the angel said to me  `` write this : great blessings belong to those who are invited to the wedding meal of the E1600 ! \\'\\' \\n then the angel said  `` these are the true words of god . \\'\\' \\n then i bowed down before the angel \\'s feet to worship [him] . \\n but the angel said to me  `` do n\\'t worship me ! \\n i am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the truth of E1293 . \\n so worship god ! \\n because the truth of E1293 is the spirit of prophecy . \\'\\' \\n then i saw heaven open . \\n there before me was a white horse . \\n the rider on the horse was called faithful and true  because [he] is right in [his] judging and in making war . \\n [his] eyes were like burning fire . \\n [he] had many crowns on [his] head . \\n a name was written on [him]  but [he] was the only one who knew its meaning . \\n [he] was dressed in a robe dipped in blood  and [he] was called the word of god . \\n the armies of heaven were following the rider on the white horse . \\n they were also riding white horses . \\n they were dressed in fine linen  white and clean . \\n a sharp sword came out of the rider \\'s mouth  a sword that [he] would use to defeat the nations . \\n and [he] will rule the nations with a rod of iron . \\n [he] will crush the grapes in the winepress of the terrible anger of god all - powerful . \\n on [his] robe and on [his] leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords then i saw an angel standing in the sun . \\n in a loud voice the angel said to all the birds flying in the sky  `` come together for the great supper of god . \\n come together so that you can eat the bodies of rulers and army commanders and famous men . \\n come to eat the bodies of the horses and their riders and the bodies of all people -- free  slave  small  and great . \\'\\' \\n then i saw the beast and the rulers of the earth . \\n their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and [his] army . \\n but the beast was captured  and the false prophet was also captured . \\n [he] was the one who did the miracles for the beast . \\n [he] had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its idol . \\n the false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur . \\n their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse . \\n all the birds ate these bodies until they were full . \\n %um  how are you guys ? \\n how is E4168 \\n and how are you ? \\n well pretty well . \\n E4168 is not here at the moment . \\n [she] \\'s been away with [her] class oh . up around blandenburg for about two weeks on a  what they call feldmessen . \\n feldmessen is  %um  surveying . \\n %hm . \\n %uh  so [she] \\'s been away for two weeks . \\n [she] \\'s coming back tonight . \\n ha . \\n so we \\'re looking forward to that . \\n oh  i \\'m sorry we \\'re going to miss [her] . \\n yeah  \\n oh gosh . i bet you \\'re getting lonely . \\n yeah  \\n well . E7501 \\'s been here \\n and we \\'ve been doing okay . \\n %mm . \\n and i \\'m actually waiting for E7501 to show up because we were supposed to go into town and meet some people in town . \\n i \\'ve got a student here who \\'s checking out rooms and stuff . \\n %mm . \\n [she] \\'s coming in the fall  \\n but [she] was in a place called taiwa . \\n you know tufts yeah . sent [her] to taiwa \\n i had friends there . [she] did a course in taiwa \\n and then [she] came over here  and %um  checked out a room here . \\n and so it \\'s \\n and the end semester is still going . \\n of course it ends on the twenty second of july . \\n mhm . \\n so  %uh oh  yeah . things are busy . \\n yeah  \\n gosh . \\n yeah . \\n you still got another month . \\n and then  are you coming over to the states at all this summer ? \\n no . \\n no . \\n no  no . %uh \\n not even E4168 ? \\n no  no  no . %uh \\n not enough relatives left here anymore ? \\n well the relative scene is kind of sad . \\n you know everybody \\'s kind of passed away  almost . \\n yeah  \\n i remember when i talked to you in the fall yeah . yeah . that %uh \\n it \\'s just about \\n oh did your sister die ? \\n my sister passed away  \\n yeah . \\n i do n\\'t know if you spoke to me before that or when it was that was happening . or \\n i guess not \\n when was it ? \\n it may have been right after . \\n well \\n my father died right after we talked . \\n oh god . \\n yeah . \\n yeah  \\n we \\'re getting old . \\n no  it \\'s  \\n i do n\\'t know what it is . \\n it \\'s just  %uh  people get sick  \\n and they get sick pretty young  \\n and  \\n yeah . \\n and you know my sister was n\\'t that old \\n and [she] just had bad luck i guess is all you can say . \\n yeah . \\n i \\'m going to put you on after fifteen minutes . \\n i \\'ve got to \\n and there was n\\'t anything anybody could do . \\n so . \\n and then an aunt of E4168 \\'s aunt E6066 up in maine passed away . \\n that had n\\'t happ-  \\n had that happened already ? \\n no \\n no that had not happened  no . \\n [she] passed away in about march or \\n yeah  i think that there was some concern about [her] when i talked to you in september or october . \\n . \\n yeah . \\n no  [she] was not doing well . \\n [she] had a brain tumor . \\n and then they operated on \\n and things were n\\'t going well  \\n and . \\n i actually got to see [her] i guess a day before [she] died . \\n oh . \\n i mean [she] did n\\'t know that i was there . \\n if that was you  yeah . yeah  [she] was just not in \\n so it was a blessing  i guess . \\n but  %um . \\n anyway  weird stuff . \\n yeah . \\n yeah . \\n and how about you ? \\n because  i r- \\n oh i \\'m han- \\n how are your eyes ? \\n yeah . \\n well  i do n\\'t know . \\n i have to go next week you know to see again . \\n i  %um  not exactly convinced that . it \\'s okay . you know  \\n i \\'m not sure . \\n %hm . \\n %uh  it \\'s been pretty good . \\n it was about eighty percent for a while . \\n and then %um  i \\'m not exactly sure what it is now . \\n but i \\'ll know in a couple of days . \\n so are you having blurred vision ? \\n or \\n oh yeah  yeah . \\n sure . \\n the right eye is %uh  not so great . \\n %hm . \\n %um  and it got back to about eighty percent . \\n you know it was a detached retina . \\n right . \\n and then they operated on it once  \\n and they operated on it twice . \\n and  then things seemed to be doing pretty well  \\n and at the moment i \\'m %um  not quite so sure . \\n %hm . \\n so  who knows . %um . \\n %hm . \\n but you know it \\'ll never be more than about seventy or eighty percent . which is fine . \\n eighty percent is fantastic . \\n right . \\n right . \\n %um \\n so we \\'ll just see . you know \\n %hm . we \\'ll see what happens . \\n frustrating . \\n %uh  yeah . \\n annoying . \\n and that thing that came up recently   you know i had  oh  a kind of a knee problem a couple of years ago . \\n and my right knee  \\n and now it \\'s my left knee . \\n you know  it \\'s just a pain in the ass . \\n and yeah . %um  i went to the doctor \\n and they do a punktion . ich weiss nicht wer . \\n anyway they take  %uh fluid out of it . \\n uh-huh . \\n and if it gets irritated take some pills and stuff . \\n and  it \\'s just a pain in the ass . \\n so it \\'s just  l- . \\n is that like water on the knee ? \\n is that what that is ? \\n %um  well that \\'s what happens . \\n it develops because of irritation  because of a %um  inflammation . \\n %hm . \\n is that from the running ? \\n and how the inflammation d- \\n yeah  \\n maybe . \\n i mean they do n\\'t know . \\n mhm . \\n they do n\\'t \\n it just came overnight practically . \\n wow . \\n %um  and %uh  we \\'d been up in berlin \\n and we had a big trip up there and did a lot of walking  a lot of fast walking and stuff . \\n but you know  i mean that mhm . should n\\'t be a big deal . %um \\n was this last crop of **tuftees** good ? \\n so . \\n was your last crop of students from tufts good ? \\n how \\'s that ? \\n yeah \\n well they \\'re still here . \\n right  \\n but they \\'re winding down  so you know them really well by this point . \\n they \\'re winding down . \\n yeah  \\n they \\'re very good . \\n they learned a lot of german . \\n they learned an amazing amount of german . \\n before i forget  i saw E861 silinas a couple of days ago . \\n oh . how \\'s [he] doing ? \\n and [he] \\'s had \\n well [he] \\'s working for an american firm over here  \\n and [he] \\'s doing very very well . %um  \\n and [his] wife just had their fourth child . \\n wow . \\n a little boy . E1811 . \\n yeah . \\n wow . \\n %um  about  %uh  two weeks ago maybe . \\n %huh . \\n tops . \\n and i got a card from  \\n you remember E4871 gleason ? \\n yeah . \\n yeah . \\n well [she] just had a baby a couple of \\n heard that . \\n well this is number two . \\n okay . \\n i just got a card from E3698 and E6645  \\n oh . \\n and they see E4871 gleason on occasion . \\n and so i think they told me that . \\n yeah . \\n have you heard from E3698 and E6645 ? \\n not in a while  no . \\n they are now living in rhode island . \\n you probably knew that . \\n well . yeah . \\n and [she] \\'s teaching at u r i . \\n yeah . \\n and it was a very nice letter  because it sounded like [she] went through very similar things that i did . \\n you know  i went from chicago to u c s g to here . \\n right . \\n and it \\'s just such an intellectual letdown . \\n right . \\n and [she] went from E6592  %um to columbia . to columbia to u r i . \\n well columbia \\'s okay . \\n yeah . \\n and [she] said the students are just  \\n you know  they do n\\'t care  \\n and they \\'re not very good  \\n and all of a sudden [she] \\'s getting conference papers rejected \\n and [she] thinks it \\'s the affiliation . \\n yeah . \\n because [she] does n\\'t think the quality of [her] work has changed . \\n now i have n\\'t submitted a conference paper with the missouri %um  you know  affiliation yet . \\n because the last one i submitted  %um  was in the fall  \\n and i still had my san E933 affiliation . \\n yeah . \\n %um  in fact i \\'m still officially on leave . \\n if anything came up in the next year we could still go back . uh-huh . %uh you know  for E916 . \\n wow . \\n but i think it \\'s very very very very yeah . unlikely . \\n yeah . \\n but at any rate it was nice to hear from [her] because [she] said after two years there now  [she] %um has come to terms with this  \\n and yeah . [she] \\'s accepted that there \\'s a lot of good things in rhode island . \\n and  %um  you know  their life is a lot less complicated  \\n and [she] has more time to be a parent . \\n yeah . \\n good . \\n and [she] \\'s just not going to have the same kind of career that [she] had thought about . \\n E3698 is working as a financial consultant for  %um  E4384 lynch . \\n and [he] \\n oh . \\n yeah  [he] had been doing work for some environmental firm  as a consultant . \\n uh-huh . \\n and  it did n\\'t work out . \\n %um [he] was changing projects every couple of weeks \\n and [he] said [he] could n\\'t keep on top of it . \\n [he] could n\\'t learn the whole new area %mm . that fast each time . \\n %mm . \\n %um  and [he] says [he] went in and had some tests  \\n and [he] was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder . \\n which you know  given how far [he] \\'s gotten  you know  [he] got [his] degree at tufts and all  i found that surprising that for the first time as an adult they \\'re diagnosing this . %um \\n %mm . i wonder about it . \\n but anyway . \\n yeah  \\n but that \\'s what [he] said . \\n and %um \\n yeah . \\n [he] %um \\n whatever \\'s helpful . \\n right . \\n so [he] found this new job as a financial consultant and seems to be happy with that . \\n good . \\n and then we saw E488 and E733 at christmas time . \\n uh-huh . \\n and they \\'re doing great . \\n %um  they had just moved to [he] \\'s in new york now  right ? a really nice house in westchester . \\n yeah  good . an older home that you know E733 is of course carving up and making beautiful . %um \\n uh-huh . \\n now [she] had a job with an architectural group when [she] first got out to new york  \\n and that did n\\'t work out . \\n [she] said they had [her] doing things that [she] really was n\\'t qualified to do %ah . and that [she] really did n\\'t feel competent doing . \\n and  they mutually agreed that [she] should leave . \\n and so [she] was looking for another job . \\n and  %um  i \\'m sure [she] \\'ll find one . \\n [she] \\'s so talented . \\n [she] may have found one by now . %um \\n yeah  \\n oh yeah . \\n amazing  \\n yeah . \\n yeah  \\n and so we met  %um  %uh E4917  their kid  who was three uh-huh . and just a really lovely little boy . \\n right \\n yeah \\n [he] \\'s so big . \\n well   E488 \\'s big . you know  \\n [he] \\'s got E488 \\'s genes . \\n yeah . \\n yeah . \\n and %uh E3698 and E6645 sent us a picture of theirs \\n and [he] has E3698 \\'s expressions . \\n [he] really looks like E3698 . \\n oh that \\'s life . \\n %um  and [he] looked really big too . \\n in this picture  [he] \\'s three and a half . \\n yeah . \\n %huh . \\n %um  but E488 and E733 just seemed  %um sort of happy with the decisions they \\'ve made . \\n and \\n good . \\n %um  like every \\n now is [he] with a publishing house now ? \\n which one is [he] with . \\n yes which one %um \\n well i can \\n yeah \\n it \\'s one of these sort of universi- the public university book stuff . \\n it might be hard core brace . \\n i \\'m not sure . \\n oh yeah . \\n i have two friends in publishing . \\n it may be the other one that just took the job with hard core brace \\n i do n\\'t remember which one . \\n yeah . \\n anyway  [he] \\'s enjoying it and liking it \\n and they \\'re doing okay . \\n yeah \\n [he] seems to feel really like [he] \\'s doing the right thing \\n and [he] is great still in academic publishing . \\n my other friend just moved to trade publishing after years in academic publishing \\n and mhm %um you know . it feels like maybe [she] made a compromise \\n but it \\'s like three times the money as with everything else \\n so \\n wow wow \\n industry and academics %um \\n terrible \\n yeah it \\'s amazing \\n and %um you know ages ago i got a card from E5100 gana . \\n i told you this . \\n because %uh you showed us [her] picture . \\n yeah \\n yeah \\n crazy \\n %um and i keep thinking maybe i \\'d get in touch \\n but i have n\\'t done it . \\n and then i saw in the %um tufts thing that E3297 totta you know in the alumni thing is living in the \\n yeah \\n so  anyway  how are you doing these days ? \\n things are going very well . \\n i think i had mentioned before %uh  that there \\'s a company now that i \\'m working with %um  %uh  which is very much just myself and guss . \\n oh . \\n and that %um \\n no  you had n\\'t mentioned that . \\n %eh  oh  okay . \\n okay  so %um \\n %eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at  \\n and you were entertaining offers . \\n and  %uh \\n well it seemed to make sense since i had a client to just kind of set up my own company  of sorts . \\n %um oh . so things are going extremely well . \\n so  i had one client who said that [he] \\'d pay me a minimum amount . \\n you know  [he]  %uh  \\n there would be a minimum amount of work  of about %uh  a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . which is sufficient to pay all my bills then \\n so i decided that it would make sense to do this . \\n %um and  %um  i \\'ve been getting substantially more work than then . \\n %mm . \\n so i \\'m quite pleased . \\n well that \\'s good . \\n %um  so i have a bunch of %uh work that i need to do on my flat this year . \\n i \\'ve been telling you that i needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time . \\n but  %uh  it should come out this year . \\n oh  well that \\'s good . \\n it should be done in a few months . \\n oh  yeah \\n i remember so you talking a little bit about it at one point . \\n yeah  \\n yeah . \\n so you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ? \\n %um . i do n\\'t see the finances occurring uh-huh  right . for a while . \\n %um  actually right at the moment finances are not going real well . \\n but %ah well . i am working on that one . \\n %uh . \\n it \\'s just but %um %uh  %uh  the main reason for that is i had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh  related to a couple of burglaries that i had . \\n oh  harsh . harsh . \\n yeah . \\n yeah  \\n and . \\n not a whole lot i can do about that now . \\n indeed . indeed . \\n have to deal with the situation . \\n and \\n so that \\'s what i \\'m doing . \\n sounds good . \\n but %um anyway  %uh one of the main reasons that i \\'ve been such a pathetic  %uh  correspondent has been work . \\n i \\'ve actually been doing a lot of it . \\n oh wow . \\n and %uh  i turned in my master \\'s thesis back in E4615  \\n and i \\'m actually presently working on  %um  several  %uh  articles oh  okay . impressive . from it . \\n yeah  \\n actually it turns out that one thing  one little bit in what i was doing  %uh  is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh  from what i had been reading in the literature . \\n you see the one very annoying thing about all of this  was my advisor has been in E2648 for a year and a half . \\n yeah . \\n and this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n\\'t much discussion . \\n yeah . \\n yup  \\n yup . \\n but  %um anyway  i had been kind of telling [him] that  you know  from my reading of the literature  i thought that this one little alteration i had made in my model was kind of clever and unique . \\n mhm . \\n and it made the one type of solution occur  which was seen experimentally  \\n but none of the other models %uh  had ? \\n yes . \\n the-  \\n i \\'m looking at  %um  multi mode lasers . \\n and one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased  %uh  states  where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser  you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency . \\n yes . \\n okay . \\n if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those  you get more than one frequency . \\n okay . \\n so what \\'s happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other \\'s exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies . \\n and %uh with a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient  \\n but you ca n\\'t find that frequency in a driven  %uh  frequency . \\n you ca n\\'t find so that it will sustain . \\n okay . \\n yes . \\n so yeah  that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly . \\n and so you should n\\'t actually really be able to ever see it . \\n %hm . \\n the only thing is  that  when you do the experiment you see it . \\n got it  \\n got it . \\n i see . \\n so  %um  i found a simple modification of the original formula  which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . and in most cases  %uh  insoluble . \\n but yeah . it gives a driving term . \\n oh  okay . \\n so  it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer  you just ca n\\'t always write it down very easily . \\n exactly . \\n oh wow . \\n so you \\'re pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser  %uh  whatever it is science . \\n but \\n which  %um  is kind of interesting considering that that \\'s not really my thing . . indeed . indeed . being an experimentalist  not a theorist . \\n %um indeed . oh wow . oh  impressive . but \\n so are you going to get an article in nature or something ? \\n %um  actually  i \\'m not sure if we \\'re shooting for op-  \\n i think optics letters is probably the one that we \\'re shooting for  or else  perhaps  though i do n\\'t think it \\'s quite that significant  would be phys rev letters . \\n %hm . \\n but  %uh  we want to write a letter  and then a couple articles . \\n yeah . \\n %hm . impressive . \\n and i do n\\'t know how much you know about scientific literature  \\n but letters are much more prestigious than  articles . \\n oh  okay . \\n oh  i did n\\'t realize that . \\n okay . \\n yeah  \\n so that \\'s why it \\'s actually a big deal is \\n i mean  you know  writing a couple of articles based on your master \\'s thesis  is  not at all unusual in physics \\n and yeah . %uh  it \\'s the fact that i would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all . \\n and what \\'s actually kind of interesting is i kept telling E7133 that i thought that this was kind of significant . \\n and E7133 kept writing back that i should tone this part of the thesis down that you know  people see the anti phased motion  \\n and it \\'s true \\n they do in the transients \\n and i was having a lot of trouble getting across to [him] that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients yes . %eh and not driven . \\n and  %uh  what happened was after i had turned in my thesis but before i saw E7133 again  [he] went to a conference in E159 and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work  was  that their models could n\\'t show this as a driven frequency  \\n yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency . \\n oh cool . \\n and so E7133 then -- said oh just a second i -- like a week later came to E5821 mawr \\n and [he] said  hey E4689  we got to write this up . \\n exactly . \\n and i was like  well i \\'ve been telling you that E7133 . \\n indeed . \\n so cool . cool . that \\'s mostly the sort of stuff that i \\'m spending a lot of time on now . %um \\n well it \\'ll look good on your c v  your resume . \\n so you might as well spend the time . \\n yes  well  \\n %uh  no  it \\'s definitely worth doing . %um  \\n and i would have been spending more time on it if it were n\\'t for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that i \\'ve been dealing with . \\n so are you still living in that house in the middle of the park . \\n yes . \\n yeah  okay . \\n yeah . \\n i mean the thing that i- \\n this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to . \\n oh . \\n it \\'s not a question of whether or not  %uh you know  that was easy  \\n it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into . \\n exactly . \\n exactly . \\n yeah . \\n and so the problem is that now they found out that it \\'s worth breaking into . \\n yeah . \\n and unfortunately . \\n well  it \\'s kind of odd . \\n they \\'ve stolen very weird things for the most part . \\n %hm . \\n as far \\n yeah \\n as a . \\n the first time they broke in  what they stole was just bizarre  \\n mostly worthless stuff . \\n and  %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . unfortunately  because it \\'s a nice pre-amplifier  \\n it has an off board power supply which they did n\\'t steal  which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless . \\n %huh . \\n so . \\n that \\'s bizarre . bizarre . \\n so when they broke in the second time did they steal the %uh offboard amplifier ? \\n actually  no  \\n all they stole the second time was my bike . \\n %huh . \\n which was actually where the major problem came . exactly . exactly . yeah . is that i suddenly had no transportation . \\n and so  i then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike  \\n and %mm . that cost me a lot of time . \\n yeah . \\n exactly . \\n because  \\n yes \\n spending a lot of time hunting for bikes  and nah well . then getting one purchased  and then having to  you know  go get it and things like that . \\n but  that \\'s dealt with at least . \\n and so %uh  that \\'s yeah at least dealt with . \\n now i just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this . \\n but yeah . yeah . \\n at least well that would make sense during the summer %uh according to the stipulations of my fellowship  i can actually earn money during the summer . \\n but %um  guessed what happened . \\n what ? \\n %um the %um \\n again ? \\n %um 118.91_120.82_b: let \\'s see  \\n two weeks ago \\n i know E5562 is going to rhode island . \\n %eh right . \\n right . \\n did [she] see [her] mom ? \\n yes [she] did . \\n and ? \\n yes [she] did . \\n and ? \\n %um  %um  which we had already anticipated that it was going to happen . \\n i spoke to [her] mom on thursday \\n %um and i asked [her] \\n i said listen \\n i said %um please come to shabbat \\n things have come to a point where i may have to relinquish my  %uh parenting . \\n %uh would you mind %uh taking [her] back \\n and [she] said no . \\n [she] said %uh [she] \\'d be more than happy to . \\n really ? \\n this girl has everything in [her] dreams you know . \\n it is as my husband says %uh  %uh al kadir the destiny . \\n selema i \\'m telling you  \\n it is like E6290 has just painted the road \\n and all i had to do was get on it and follow it . \\n i mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me . \\n i told mom \\n i said mom it is when you believe in E6290  when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to E6290  only E6290 can make the way clear for you . \\n %uh . \\n i believe that by [her] birthday [she] will be living with [her] mother . \\n really ? \\n mhm mhm . \\n and is [she] seem like [she] \\'s together enough ? \\n [she] \\'s in a two year program . \\n [she] \\'s in the program now . \\n [she] \\'s doing very well . \\n when i talked to [her] i \\'m talking to [her] like i \\'m talking to you . \\n i wrote [her] a letter and told [her] \\n i said i feel like i know you even though i never met you . \\n they seemed surprised that  \\n i mean most women you lose your baby that \\'s it . \\n but almighty god is \\n you never even get a chance to see them again . \\n that \\'s true . \\n that \\'s true . \\n but that \\'s what [she] had wrote me . \\n [she] said it is just awesome to [her] what is happening . \\n yup . \\n mhm . \\n aw i \\'ve heard of that . \\n yup . \\n so E3709 \\n did [she] say how [she] felt about what had happened ? \\n no . \\n we have n\\'t really talked about that \\n but i \\'m planning on making a trip down to visit [her] . \\n well  how does akina feel ? \\n [she] \\'s  very happy about it . \\n very ha- \\n well did [she] come home and say i saw [her]  i look like [her] or what ? \\n we talked on the phone \\n and you know [she] talked about %um [her] sisters you know and things \\n we \\'ve spent the night with [her] sisters and things \\n and %um it \\'s just been quite interesting although when [she] was in rhode island [she] was very disruptive  %um down there and really caused E3709 a lot of stress \\n and %um E3709 was very worried about me because [she] came home two weeks before you know %um because [she] just was acting like a total nigger child . \\n uh-oh ! \\n E3737 the research did n\\'t hear that ! \\n uh-oh ! \\n wait \\n wait \\n alita i \\'m telling you nobody can handle [her] but you  okay . \\n and %um  \\n but [she] was very concerned about me and everything %um because %um the child had told some lies about me and about you . \\n oh . \\n oh 296.72_297.91_a: oh no . \\n and about \\n oh yeah mhm \\n oh goodness . \\n yeah . \\n that we were abusing  \\n that %um you know  \\n oh yeah \\n [she] did some %eh  \\n and it was very  very bad . \\n my daughter - in - law E1194 got on [her] case real serious yesterday . \\n told [her] that [she] could n\\'t talk to E3551 play with E3551 because [she] said [she] hurt E3551 \\'s jetta you know \\n and [she] said that if it was n\\'t for jetta you know E3551 \\'s daddy would n\\'t be \\n oh [she] \\'d \\n oh man %uh it was \\n aw . \\n you know that has always been very scary to me even after . \\n i said to E4263 oh my god . what \\'s [she] going to say \\n because i knew what [she] would do if i took [her] somewhere you know what [she] would say \\n and i  \\n you know in the climate of today  yes . people saying something like that . \\n that well  \\n you know that \\'s \\n and E3709 was very concerned in reference to you know [she] was in school and things \\n and [she] was very  very concerned . \\n alita [she] said this little girl has a serious problem . \\n [she] wrote me a letter mhm . you know about [her] needing a lot of love  a lot of %um help and different things like this  \\n but you know you \\'ve heard the saying i \\'m sure from your grandmother \\n the sins of your parents will be waged back at you  %hm . you know  \\n %um and again my husband said we were going to give it a month  you know and said [he] was even going to have to sheik pray over [her]  you know for the jen . \\n %hm . \\n you know  i mean  we \\'re d-  you know  \\n and i think we \\'re still going to be doing that \\n but i think [he] \\'s at a point now where [he] \\'s reserved us of that %um  you know that [she] may end up going %um to %uh t- \\n oh well the thing is your whole life has been around [her] mhm . more or less \\n mhm . mhm . \\n i mean it is you know i mean absorbed \\n mhm . mhm . \\n where is  you know \\n mhm %mm . \\n and you know  i mean \\n this is a lousy \\n %eh i truly believe that **salem** \\n i do n\\'t think  \\n you think [she] \\'ll be better with [her] mother ? \\n i have no idea . \\n i really have no idea . \\n but \\n %um  but you know the  \\n if this does happen and i do believe it may happen  %um you know we will have an agreement  [she] and i  you know  \\n %um [she] will become the legal guardian and that %um \\n %uh you know i just want [her] to understand everything that has happened in the last several years yeah . and things like that . \\n [she] needs to be clear about that because this child wo n\\'t be like the other two . \\n %eh %eh you know  %um well  [she] said that [she] was . \\n E211 said that [she] was . \\n oh yeah . \\n [she] was like [her] two daughters  \\n yeah . \\n mhm . \\n yeah . \\n they had the same  maybe just \\n problems and different  \\n [she] has n\\'t been with [her] children for ten years . \\n [her]  or [her] two girls . \\n %ah . \\n and they \\'re twelve and  \\n no they \\'re nine and thirteen or something like that . \\n yup  \\n but [she] \\'s working very hard . \\n [she] \\'s trying to become a counselor in this drug program  and things \\n and [she] sounds like [she] \\'s really trying hard . \\n and i just believe it \\'s you know time  you know \\n and  who would have ever thought it though  \\n you know what i mean ? \\n does [she] know that you \\'re muslim ? \\n mhm . \\n mhm . \\n uh-huh \\n yup . \\n yup . \\n yup \\n %um so that \\'s been my most interesting things in the last three weeks . \\n oh that \\'s some deep  \\n that \\'s just too deep . \\n yup . \\n yup . \\n mhm . \\n yup . \\n been very  very  very  heavy . \\n like mom said [she] said even if it was going to be in september  [she] said the little things i can tolerate you know if that happens you know . \\n but you know i always worried \\n you know even after you left i said  i just hope arlita knows that you know i tried my best you know \\n and everybody has to keep them  selema  everybody  everybody you know  \\n and i told [her] \\n i said you know it \\'s a shame that you ca n\\'t go no place and i can get a good report on you you know  %um  and by [her] going to E3709 and things  and E3709 seeing for herself  \\n [she] was like whoa . \\n did E3709 feel [she] had changed a lot ? \\n oh yes . \\n t-  \\n oh yes . \\n you know  mhm  mhm . \\n a-  \\n %ah . \\n %um  %um  but you know i feel very at peace about everything . \\n uh-huh . \\n i feel very at peace you know . \\n well it \\'s good to hear from E3709 who \\'s had a lot of child- \\n yes . \\n over six hundred . \\n oh . \\n over six hundred foster children . \\n oh . \\n yes . \\n mhm . \\n you know [she] would \\'ve seen it all . \\n [she] called mom to talk to mom \\n let \\'s see [she] bought  \\n i met [her] in albany \\n mhm . \\n and [she] bought [her] \\n %um [she] caught  \\n that was on friday last friday \\n [she] called mom monday and talked to mom for two hours \\n uh-huh . \\n %mm . \\n [she] talked to mom here in E159 . \\n oh you \\'re kidding \\n i was sick up in syracuse . \\n [she] talked to mom . \\n something must \\'ve been on [her] mind . \\n [she] told mom \\n [she] said [she] was so concerned that this little girl was going to just get out here cause i was n\\'t going to send back to the school  the muslim school . \\n uh-huh . \\n and [she] was just really concerned about you know everything . mhm you know . what the possibilities of like \\n sure . \\n sure . \\n yep . \\n mhm . \\n mhm . \\n well you know or luck making a way and making it at ease for you to \\n well you know why E6290 is doing this . \\n i \\'m going to tell you why \\n because my daughter - in - law is pregnant again . \\n oh no ! \\n [she] said [she] was going to call you . \\n [she] said [she] was going to call you . \\n %ah \\n i said well you call selema \\n and you tell [her] . \\n i said oh and i do n\\'t have your number in my other phonebook i said . \\n i said you just call [her] and tell [her] \\n yup [she] sure is . \\n oh my goodness . \\n goodness . \\n E687  \\n wait  \\n did they do like %uh the same thing they had to do last time ? \\n no . \\n you know what ? \\n that same thing happened to aliah . \\n no . \\n [she] had to take all that stuff the first time \\n but then the second time \\n nope . \\n [she] \\n yup . \\n yup . \\n j-  j-  \\n %uh  and mom said  \\n i mean E3551 was about two months old \\n mom said oh goodness . \\n %eh  i mean cause E3551 is not nowhere like my other little babies . \\n [she] is not cuddly sweet . \\n %mm  %mm  no w- \\n [she] do n\\'t have time for that %uh . \\n [she] does not sit still or lay still for you to change [her] pampers . \\n this little girl moves . \\n i mean you lay [her] down on the bed \\n [she] gets up \\n and [she] runs from  \\n well [she] does n\\'t run \\n but [she] crawls real fast . \\n and [she] has t- aw \\n and you \\'re like okay . \\n and [she] \\'s not a cuddly sweet little thing  \\n [she]  \\n and [she] climbs up the stairs  selema . \\n [she] \\'s seven months old \\n and [she] \\'s climbing up the stairs . \\n climbs down the stairs \\n and mom said so we found out  \\n when did we find out E1194 was pregnant ? \\n last week  we found out \\n and mom told [her] \\n mom said  E1194  E3551 is just moving \\n [she] \\'s moving out the way too quickly \\n [she] just was not a little sweet little cuddly you know  \\n no way \\n %uh lay there let me look at my grandmother kind of thing \\n no no way \\n not one bit . \\n oh oh amway is probably going to have a rule though i could just \\n i just got back from the gym . \\n oh good . \\n uh-huh . \\n how \\'s it going ? \\n oh pretty well . \\n it was really crowded today . \\n yeah . \\n i kind of assumed everyone would be at the shore . \\n uh-huh . \\n i was wrong . \\n well it \\'s the middle of the week or whatever \\n so . \\n but it \\'s the fourth of july . \\n %mm . \\n so . \\n yeah . \\n people have to work tomorrow . \\n do you have to work tomorrow ? \\n yeah . \\n did you have off yesterday ? \\n yes . \\n oh that \\'s good . \\n and i was paid too . \\n oh . \\n is it paid today ? \\n no . \\n oh . \\n but %uh \\n yeah  \\n so the gym \\'s going well . \\n oh . \\n but i still need to go more often . \\n well how often are you going ? \\n only four days a week . \\n . \\n yeah . \\n got to get that up to five . \\n %mm . \\n but  i do n\\'t really like going with E5489 E4427 because [she] does n\\'t like to stay very long . \\n why ? \\n i do n\\'t know . \\n [she] kind of  \\n well unfortunately for some reason [she] \\'s not like into cardio vascular . \\n so when i \\'m still riding the bike [she] \\'s completely finished [her] weight lifting routine . \\n mhm . \\n and like i have n\\'t even started mine . mhm . you know \\n and i kind of hinted to [her] that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular . mhm . it \\'s true . and that lifting the weights wo n\\'t lose weight . \\n %mm %mm . \\n you wo n\\'t lose it  you know  \\n but \\n no \\n i mean you might lose some \\n but that \\'s only when yo- . \\n for a woman who is lifting not that much i do n\\'t think yeah . you would . \\n i mean yeah \\n i mean the only thing is %um just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time . \\n yeah  \\n so i do n\\'t know \\n maybe [she] \\'ll catch on soon . \\n you do burn a lot of calories an hour though  lifting weights . \\n uh-huh . \\n but %uh \\n yeah \\n i mean i do n\\'t think you \\'re going to lose that much . \\n and also lifting weights at bally \\'s means you \\'re standing on line for as much time as you \\'re actually lifting . \\n really . \\n yeah . \\n that \\'s too bad . \\n yeah . \\n so is it really overcrowded ? \\n well  i mean obviously since i work i ca n\\'t get there until about six o\\'clock at night which is when everyone else gets there . \\n mhm . \\n mhm . \\n but i \\'m sure for people who go in the daytime it \\'s probably dead . yeah . you know \\n and %um  like when i go saturday and sunday mornings it \\'s totally dead . \\n mhm . \\n so \\n but you know the weeknights is pretty crazy . \\n yeah . \\n yeah \\n i found a gym yesterday here that \\'s only eight pounds a month which is like twelve dollars  twelve fifty \\n oh yeah . \\n wow . \\n yeah . \\n it \\'s at the hospital nearby . \\n well that \\'s a deal . \\n yeah . \\n yeah . \\n so uh-huh . i think %um tonight E583 and i are going to go over and join up . \\n even E583 \\'s going to join ? \\n no  \\n but it has to be debited from a bank account so it \\'s got to be debited from [his] . \\n yeah . \\n in your letter you said that [he] eats constantly . \\n oh my god . \\n really ? \\n E5995  i \\'ve never seen anybody eat as much as [he] does \\n and [he] \\'s so skinny . \\n mhm . \\n i mean the amount of cereal [he] eats like between meals and after meals \\n yeah . \\n and we go through a box of cereal every two days . \\n really ? \\n yeah . \\n wow . \\n [he] eats at least like four of cereal a day like in addition to like meals . \\n uh-huh \\n and when [he] goes to work [he] brings four sandwiches with [him]  uh-huh . a bag of potato chips uh-huh . %um you know and then little sweetie things chocolates and **cakies** and stuff like that . \\n uh-huh \\n and then you know before [he] leaves every morning [he] has like two fried eggs mhm on toast with cheese %um vegetarian sausages %um and like fruit \\n and oh my god it \\'s just crazy . \\n mhm . \\n it \\'s crazy how much [he] eats . \\n [he] was probably starving when [he] was here . \\n yeah . \\n i think what we got to do is just when [he] comes just have lots of cereal . \\n [he] likes cocoa pops . \\n oh boy . \\n wow . \\n that \\'s pretty crazy . \\n yeah . \\n it \\'s all about being a blue collar man . \\n i guess so . \\n they \\'re the ones who can eat all day . \\n really ? \\n well i mean [he] does work [his] ass off \\n so \\n yeah . \\n but %uh 291.01_291.28_b: %hm . \\n %hm . \\n so  i assume it \\'s hard for you not to eat as much as [he] does . \\n no . \\n i learned quick fast in a hurry because i \\'ve gained so much weight . \\n oh really ? \\n yeah . \\n actually in the first week i was here -- mhm . -- i gained a lot \\n so . \\n well it \\'s hard to you know not eat when somebody else is eating . \\n well i \\'m figuring it out fast because -- okay -- with not working out and all yeah . it \\'s pretty miserable my crunch tape . \\n %mm . \\n so i called this woman today \\n and %um  [she] \\'s a dressmaker \\n and we \\'re going to go see [her] next thursday and talk about [her] making my wedding dress . \\n slate green . \\n yeah . \\n %uh . \\n E5763  that way i can have exactly what i want . \\n exactly . \\n and it \\'s only going to be about two hundred and fifty pounds which is about three hundred and fifty dollars . \\n uh-huh . \\n so it \\'s pretty good i mean comparatively . \\n yeah . \\n and it \\'ll be exactly what i want \\n and it \\'ll look good on me  you know like fit me  sure . which is necessary at the moment because i \\'m plump \\n so . \\n mhm . \\n now  daddy got %um the invitations together for you today . \\n uh-huh . \\n and in it i put  %um paint samples from E1730 williams uh-huh . of all the different like shades of what color i thought you might be thinking of for the bride \\'s maids . \\n uh-huh . \\n oh i already told them all black \\n but dad does n\\'t want black [he] said . \\n mom and dad wo n\\'t have black . \\n they do n\\'t want black ? \\n they \\'re really opposed to it . \\n did you call E2217 and tell [her] that ? \\n no . \\n could you do that ? \\n okay . \\n could you call E479 and tell [her] that ? \\n yeah . \\n just say you know my parents are really opposed to black . \\n yeah . \\n they wo n\\'t buy me a black dress . \\n they wo n\\'t ? \\n here wait . \\n let me look for my phonebook . \\n no . \\n never mind . \\n i can just open the thing here . \\n now wait . \\n what  \\n god we got so much furniture in this tiny apartment . \\n it \\'s crazy . \\n there \\'s drawers everywhere  to figure out where everything is . \\n okay . \\n let me give you E479 \\'s phone number . \\n you can just leave a message . \\n okay . \\n okay . \\n two one  two one two uh-huh . two two six uh-huh . o one two five . \\n okay . \\n okay . \\n i \\'ll do that . \\n but %uh  \\n yeah  \\n apparently like at E5013 manachi \\'s wedding like the whole night people were talking about how bad the black dresses were . \\n really ? \\n like everyone at mom and dad \\'s table . \\n yeah . \\n who was at mom and dad \\'s table ? \\n weirdo \\n just all of E1187 \\'s friends . mhm . who you know of course most of them mom and dad had at least met once before . \\n mhm . \\n but %uh \\n yeah  \\n and E3683 still talks about the black dress . \\n what ? \\n how hideous they were . \\n E3683 was n\\'t at E5013 manachi \\'s . \\n E3683 went to the mass wedding . \\n [she] did ? \\n uh-huh . \\n oh . \\n and [she] wanted me to take [her] \\n and i refused to go \\n and [she] got mad . \\n really ? \\n well i said i would not feel comfortable going . \\n i was not invited . mhm . you know \\n and mom and dad were like well you know a wedding that \\'s a mass is open to everyone . \\n i was like well that \\'s fine \\n but i would not feel comfortable going . \\n mhm . \\n i think that would be obnoxious \\n and i think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me . \\n right . \\n to -- -- you know the other thing  the reception . \\n i just would n\\'t go . \\n %mm . \\n so they had to take it down and drive [her] home . \\n %mm . \\n so they \\'re always kind of pissy at me . \\n %mm . that \\'s okay . \\n yeah . \\n yeah . \\n i mean i \\'ve been thinking about it \\n and the black \\'s not going to be so hot you know \\n but \\n mhm . \\n yeah . \\n apparently they were also carrying lillies which is kind of goofy . \\n yeah . \\n well i guess [she] did that because someone suggested that to [her] because you know the lillies the symbol of the virgin E4226 . \\n mhm . \\n white lillies ? \\n white lillies and black dresses . \\n %mm  my goodness . \\n that \\'s funny . \\n yeah . \\n yeah . \\n E3683 was carrying on that [she] thought [she] was at a funeral \\n and [she] had to keep reminding herself . \\n %mm . \\n so now you think my wedding \\'s going to be pretty tasteful right ? \\n but \\n oh yeah . \\n now what about the matchbooks ? \\n well i \\'ll work on it . \\n i still think about the matchbooks . \\n yeah . \\n i \\'ll tell dad that you still think about the \\n i have n\\'t forgotten those \\n and they \\'ll still be enough time when i come home for me to order those . \\n yeah . \\n i \\'ll have remind [him] of that little -- -- item . \\n yeah . \\n %huh how fun- . \\n you know i was talking to my friend E4473 from wisconsin the other day -- \\n -- and [she] \\'s telling me about you know [her] sister \\'s wedding . \\n and at [her] sister \\'s wedding %uh  they provided champagne and beer . \\n but if you wanted any other kind of drink you had to pay for it . \\n mhm . \\n yeah . \\n that \\'s actually kind of common \\n but -- oh it is . it \\'s pretty de classe . \\n well i kind of thou-  \\n i mean of course i did n\\'t say anything to [her] . \\n yeah . \\n you know i said as far as i knew we were n\\'t charging people . \\n yeah . \\n now \\n but %uh  \\n yeah \\n dad and i went to buy the wine the other day . \\n and there were having a sale on the wine dad wanted . \\n are you talking to me ? \\n of course i \\'m talking to you . \\n i can hardly hear you . \\n oh . \\n i thought you were talking to somebody else and like put the phone down or something . \\n i \\'m talking to you . \\n oh . \\n yeah . \\n no dad told me that . \\n oh [he] did tell you . \\n it \\'s all chilean . \\n yeah . \\n yeah . \\n walnut crest or walnut creek or -- %mm . -- something like that . \\n i do n\\'t know . \\n %mm . \\n there \\'s a pretty good sale . %mm . so now we have to keep our eyes open for a champagne sale . \\n an-  \\n do you know if E6876 called E4564 yet ? \\n i told [him] this morning to do it this week . \\n uh-huh . \\n and [he] just keeps forgetting . \\n yeah . \\n but o- \\n how \\'s [he] doing ? \\n much better . \\n yeah ? \\n yeah . \\n [he] \\'s often chipper . \\n [he] went for a walk this morning at five seventeen . \\n pe- \\n oh my god . \\n is that because [he] \\'s not sleeping and \\n well because [he] could n\\'t breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom . \\n oh . \\n so i think it \\'s time to give all the cats a bath . \\n %mm . \\n yeah \\n and the-  \\n you should do that . \\n i know . \\n it \\'s a two person job though . \\n i \\'ll have to get somebody to help me . \\n %mm . yeah . \\n %hm . \\n but %uh  yeah  \\n it \\'s still a fairly expensive call \\n %uh but it \\'s a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we actually make my parents in law pay it  \\n then it \\n the dutch have such high taxes on those \\n they consider it a luxury to call around the world \\n so they tax it really high . \\n anyway %um \\n so you guys will be in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth \\n and you \\'re going to go to %uh amsterdam . \\n well i would say is once you \\'re at a hotel uh-huh %um  why do n\\'t you call me at work and let me know where you are  \\n and then we can make arrangements that day %um  that i can meet you in amsterdam . \\n and maybe i \\'ll come by  public transport . \\n it \\'s probably easier for me to come by public transport in amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest . \\n mhm . \\n the streets are small \\n and there \\'s no parking . \\n so i probably will come by public transport \\n but i do n\\'t know . \\n we \\'ll see where you \\'re staying \\n %um \\n and there \\'s a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff \\n you can see stuff in amsterdam \\n and %uh since the days are really long  \\n i mean it stays light here till about ten thirty eleven o\\'clock mhm . at night . \\n so if you want we can take a ride and go see stuff at night \\n and i can take you to some places  \\n we can %uh go see some stuff . \\n %um  depends on what you guys want to see . \\n so you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know . \\n okay \\n %um and i \\'ll sit and talk with E6259 about some things that maybe we think that it would be neat for you to see . \\n so if you do n\\'t have any ideas we \\'ll just put something together for you . \\n okay . \\n %um but yeah \\n but i can pick you up th-  \\n you know i \\'ll probably be there some time around six \\n and we can like do a quick dinner or something yeah and go see whatever you want to see  \\n if you want to stay in amsterdam that \\'s fine . \\n if you want to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of  echte holland  real holland and we can do that too . \\n actually i \\'ve been up to holland before . \\n spent about two weeks up there . \\n yeah . \\n so %um  \\n but that was years and years ago . \\n with your parents when your father was stationed over here  right ? \\n yeah . \\n but we got to see den haag and places like that too which we \\'re obviously not going to see this time . \\n but %um \\n has E6774 been here before ? \\n and  an- \\n no . \\n oh good . \\n but then again i \\'m not sure that E6774 would be interested in seeing shape headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff . those military things . \\n would you be interested in seeing shape headquarters again . \\n no . not really . \\n yeah . \\n i did n\\'t think so . \\n somehow i had this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you . \\n yep . \\n i \\'m  \\n the mil-  \\n i ca n\\'t say too bad things about the military though . \\n they still have my goods \\n and they \\'ll probably hold them hostage . \\n and they own my body and soul for like another four years \\n so i just got to pray that they \\n oh do they ? \\n yeah . \\n i owe four years in active reserve time . \\n aw great . \\n do they do that to everyone ? \\n E2449  get out of there \\n yeah -- -- %eh everyone %uh who has n\\'t been like you were \\n you went through like the thirty six two process . \\n mhm . \\n so you do n\\'t have it \\n but yeah if you just separate normally and you have n\\'t served at least eight years  then you owe it . \\n and that \\'s one of those things they just never tell you up front . \\n no . \\n they never said anything \\n i figured there was something like that because \\n and i was in the inactive reserves the entire time i was in college too . \\n so . \\n yeah . \\n i mean that \\'s the military . \\n i have my discharge papers and everything \\n uh-huh . \\n and i \\'ve said that yeah i will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they call me back for those  but they \\'re going to have to pay my trip back to the states . because there \\'s no bases in holland and i \\'m not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to germany or something for them . \\n if they want me they can pay  \\n bring me back active duty and pay me for the day if they \\'re going to drag me off somewhere . \\n but %uh  first they have to find me . \\n yeah  that \\'s the other \\n it was i-  \\n if you \\'re in another country i mean and you \\'re not planning on coming back to the u s what are they going to do even if you do n\\'t . \\n yeah . \\n well i mean i \\'m still american citizen \\n and i still would like to be welcome in my own country . \\n although g- \\n %uh i mean if they denied my citizenship and i became a citizen here i probably would n\\'t be a horror either  \\n but %uh yeah \\n right now i mean i do want to keep my american citizenship \\n so . \\n i kind of want to \\n are you going to become a dual citizen ? \\n what \\'s that ? \\n are you going to try and become a dual citizen ? \\n have dual citizenship ? \\n you ca n\\'t do that  \\n %um  the only way to be a dual citizen is if you \\'re born in a foreign country \\n like if i were born in holland and then had american parents . then i could be a dual citizen . \\n but you ca n\\'t \\n if i would to ask to become a citizen in holland i would automatically lose my american citizenship . \\n as far as the americans are concerned  yeah . \\n yeah . \\n the dutch could care less . \\n the dutch would say fine \\n want to be a dual citizen  \\n that \\'s fine  \\n but the americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your american citizenship . \\n i mean it \\'s kind of stupid . \\n yeah . \\n so i \\'m an expatriot . \\n an american expatriot . \\n an american living abroad . \\n i still have to file a tax return . \\n do you ? \\n yeah . \\n but my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax free . \\n good grief . \\n as long as i do n\\'t bring it back to the states . \\n good grief . \\n i r s for you  %huh ? \\n yeah . \\n oh they want their share . \\n they want their piece of meat . \\n but all foreign taxes are deductible  \\n and my taxes here are fifty percent of income . \\n so the taxes here are so much higher that  yeah i would never have to worry about it . \\n unless you became c e o of the company then maybe like a thousand dollars would be taxable  right ? \\n yeah . \\n somehow it raises a small amount . \\n the problem \\'s going to %uh be E6259 \\'s american salary is taxable here and at fifty percent \\n so we \\'re going to owe some money to the dutch government on [her] salary . \\n aw . \\n some amount that has to be deducted a certain amount \\n and the amount we pay the american government is deductible  \\n but we \\'ll still owe some taxes . \\n th-  \\n see i do n\\'t know how it works . \\n we \\'re going to be in need of some sort of accountant do it cause i have no clue how that all works . \\n they do n\\'t have the quicken dutch version ? \\n yeah . \\n %ah  you know i would n\\'t trust it because it \\'s so complicated with this international garbage or else the turbo tax with the dutch modules . that i just would n\\'t trust it . \\n i do n\\'t know  %eh . \\n yeah . \\n so complicated when you \\'re dealing with a dutch tax form . \\n E6259 had to read it \\n and E6259 and [her] father did n\\'t understand the damn thing . \\n how am i supposed to understand it ? \\n i \\'m really looking forward to moving to oregon and dealing with  \\n oregon you pay state tax \\n E4477 you do n\\'t . \\n i \\'m looking forward to that cause %uh \\n yeah \\n but you \\'ll be a student \\n so you  \\n i mean you \\'re \\n what is your income ? \\n oh  well \\n E5763 i think y-  %um  \\n it \\'ll probably be about five thousand dollars the portion of this year that i \\'m in oregon \\n and then next year it \\'ll be eleven thousand . \\n yeah . \\n but i mean you \\'re below the poverty line at that level . \\n yeah . \\n so i mean any income that y- \\n well \\n but then i \\'ve already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever here in E4477 \\n but \\n that should be non taxable out of state income . \\n it should \\n but you know it \\'s not going to be a fun tax return year . \\n i had that when i went into the military . \\n but then again . \\n i had kans-  \\n i had to file three taxes . \\n i had to file E5705  kansas yeah and then my federal . \\n so . \\n well  %um actually i think this phone call \\'s just about to end cause it \\'s only half an hour  \\n but %um \\n so let \\'s see . \\n i \\'ll give you a call when we arrive in h-  \\n or maybe i \\'ll just call you when we get in holland just to let you know we \\'re there  \\n so if we get in the eighteenth or the nineteenth and then call you back %um when we get to a hotel or something like that . \\n okay that \\'s a great idea . \\n as soon as you get into holland and get yourself settled you can call me \\n and %uh if it \\'s at night  just call E6259 \\'s parents \\n okay so \\n and remember that if you dial in holland you need to add a zero \\n so like right now okay it \\'s one eight one zero area code . \\n if you dial in holland  it \\'s zero one eight one zero . okay in holland \\n and then yeah you can just call up \\n if it \\'s during the work hours  fine  call me at work . \\n if not  call E6259 \\'s parents if you do n\\'t have a new phone number for me . \\n and if you do  i \\'ll send it by email okay if i get it before this weekend \\n we \\'ll email you something \\n but if you do n\\'t get email then just call E6259 \\'s parents \\n if we have a phone by then  they \\'ll be able to give you the number \\n okay \\n and just remember to ask for [her] mother . \\n and it \\'s goode  right \\n bode \\n bode \\n bode as in abode \\n abode \\n minus the a \\n okay \\n great \\n and \\n yeah \\n and i think %uh %uh it \\'s not frau \\n %uh %ah %uh it \\'s mifrau \\n is \\n it \\'s frau in german \\n it \\'s frau \\n mhm \\n and then dutch it \\'s mifrau \\n i \\'ll probably never remember that \\n so hope they wo n\\'t be offended . \\n nah do n\\'t worry about it . \\n you can just call [her] missus \\n you can just call [her] missus and speak english to [her] . \\n [she] understands \\n just talk slowly and clearly . \\n okay \\n and once you \\'re in holland the line will be really clear . \\n i mean the phones here are pretty good . once you \\'re in the country . \\n it \\'s just these to america \\n it \\'s always kind of iffy \\n the hot dialogue ... that went on between -lsb- -lsb- -lsb- E2809 E3964 and rumsfeld -rsb- -rsb- -rsb- at the airport prison . \\n collaborator \\n details of the minutes of the meeting between rumsfeld and E2809 E3964 at the airport prison ... \\n E4477 offers E2809 a television appearance to stop the resistance in return for [his] freedom . \\n baghdad - ina - from aras an nasiri \\n minutes of the dialogue between E2809 and rumsfeld from trusted american sources . \\n what follows is the text of the minutes \\n at the start of the conversation president E2809 appeared extremely calm . \\n perhaps [he] was surprised that [his] guest was rumsfeld  but [he] did not appear at all nervously tense . \\n rumsfeld began the conversation by saying rumsfeld : i came to meet you to negotiate the situation in iraq ; we have made contact with some of your followers inside and outside iraq  they have advised us to listen to you . \\n E2809 E3964 : so what do you want ? \\n your forces have occupied the territory of the proud iraq  you have brought down the governing regime without a legal support  \\n you have assaulted the sovereignty of an independent free sovereign country  \\n you have committed crimes which history will record against you as evidence of your blood - stained civilization . \\n so what do you want after all that ? \\n rumsfeld -lrb- trying to suppress [his] anger -rrb- : what \\'s past is past  i came especially to make you a clear and specific offer and i want to hear from you a clear and definite answer . \\n E2809 E3964 -lrb- mockingly -rrb- : i thought you had come to apologize and restore power to the iraqis . \\n rumsfeld : we have nothing to apologize for  you constituted a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction and practiced dictatorship over your people and so it was only natural that we extended our hand to the people of iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades . \\n E2809 E3964 : i know that you are ignorant of history  and i know that your president is no less ignorant but it seems that you have continued to lie to the extent that you now believe yourselves . \\n if  by our neighbors  you mean the zionist entity then we did indeed form a danger  we were preparing to liberate our ravished territory in palestine . \\n this is the wish of every arab person and not just every iraqi . \\n for this is arab land and its people are arab  and the zionists are the ones who occupied the land and came to us from all over the world with your help  yours  and that of the old imperial powers . \\n but if you meant kuwait  i want to ask you . \\n did you withdraw from kuwait or not ? \\n rumsfeld : these are security issues . \\n besides  there are security agreements between us and kuwait and the other gulf states ... we came at their request to protect them from your threats . \\n E2809 E3964 : is n\\'t funny that the wolf is being entrusted with the sheep ? \\n the people of kuwait are an arab people . \\n and kuwait is iraqi territory  therefore i ask you to read history carefully  although i am certain that you wo n\\'t comprehend it . \\n rumsfeld : stop from this drivel  i am offering you ... \\n E2809 E3964 -lrb- interrupting -rrb- : before you offer me your rotten goods  i ask you did you find weapons of mass destruction in iraq or not ? \\n rumsfeld -lrb- disconcerted -rrb- : we have n\\'t found them yet  but we will surely find them one day . \\n do you deny that you had intentions to manufacture a nuclear bomb ? \\n E2809 E3964 : we have had no weapons of mass destruction since 1991  we were truthful when we spoke with the international inspection mission  we were truthful in our letters to kofi annan  you knew these facts but you were looking for any pretext to occupy iraq and topple its legitimate authority . \\n rumsfeld : the iraqis received us with overwhelming happiness and welcomed us  because of the practices of your bloody regime over the course of all those years in which you governed iraq . \\n E2809 E3964 : please  mr rumsfeld  enough lying . \\n you are the ones who have opened the floodgates to cascades of blood on the soil of iraq  you plotted against us and got some traitors to take over power over the land of the great iraq . \\n rumsfeld : those you are calling traitors have been chosen by the iraqi people as their leaders by democratic means and free elections  something that did not take place during your rule over the country . \\n E2809 E3964 : i found out that you had come with a troop of traitors led by talabani -lrb- laughs mockingly -rrb- . \\n great iraq is being ruled by talabani and jaafari . \\n is n\\'t this ridiculous ? \\n then  which elections are you talking about ? \\n is it permissible for what you call free elections to be held under your occupation of our country ? \\n mr rumsfeld  we have learned from history that the occupier will not bring except [his] assistants and lackeys  and you want  after all that  to convince me that the people of iraq enjoy freedom and democracy ? \\n you are truly delusional . \\n rumsfeld -lrb- barely able to contain [his] anger -rrb- : you are isolated and do not know the facts of what is happening on the outside . \\n the iraqi people have been liberated from your oppression  if they saw you or any of your men in the street they would kill you . \\n E2809 E3964 : i challenge you to announce your location in iraq if you can . \\n if the iraqi resistance found out your whereabouts you would not be able to get out alive . \\n i want to give a word of advice to your  dumb  president  you must pass it on to [him]  and it is that [he] should save what is left of [his] soldiers . \\n death surrounds them everywhere and history will not be merciful to [him] . \\n rumsfeld : i came to talk with you about the terrorist operations which your men are instigating and carrying out . \\n your men have recently carried out an ignoble operation aimed at the abu ghraib prison where they injured and killed more than fifty americans and also killed a number of prisoners imprisoned under various charges . \\n your men are employing terrorists from all parts of the world and they are threatening the democratic process in iraq . \\n E2809 E3964 : what is it you want exactly ? \\n rumsfeld : i am making you one offer  that you are released and choose for yourself a place of exile in any country you wish on the condition that you appear on television to announce your condemnation of the terrorism and to ask your men to stop these practices . \\n E2809 E3964 : have you obtained the consent of your president to this offer ? \\n rumsfeld : yes  this offer was agreed to at a session in which the president  [his] deputy  the secretary of state and the head of the cia took part and i was commissioned to inform you of this offer . \\n E2809 E3964 : it is a very low price . \\n rumsfeld -lrb- excited -rrb- : we are prepared to include elements close to you in power . \\n E2809 E3964 : and what else ? \\n rumsfeld : we will offer you considerable financial assistance and will look after your and your family \\'s security in the country you choose . \\n E2809 E3964 : do you want to hear my conditions ? \\n rumsfeld : yes  that would be nice . \\n E2809 E3964 -lrb- in language beaming with pride and arrogance -rrb- i want you first of all .. to set me a timetable for the withdrawal from iraq that your government will commit itself to it in front of the world  and for you to begin the withdrawal operation immediately . \\n i ask  secondly  .. for the immediate release of all the iraqi and arab detainees in the prisons you have set up or in those where you have shackled the freedom of tens of thousands of honorable iraqis . \\n thirdly  i ask you .. for the undertaking that full compensation will be offered for the material losses which the iraqi people have suffered through your aggression on our country since the mother of all battles in 1991 until this present day . \\n i will accept the assistance of an international and arab committee in estimating these losses . \\n fourthly  i ask that you produce the money which your men looted from the treasuries of iraq and its oil especially this criminal bremmer and [his] henchmen from the traitors and renegades . \\n and  fifthly  i ask for .. the return of the antiquities which you have stolen and handed over to the antiquities mafia  for these are priceless treasures because they bear the history of iraq and its civilization . \\n your country is no older than a few hundred years . \\n true  you do not have neither a civilization nor history  but all that can not excuse your thefts and your hatred of iraq \\'s civilization and iraq \\'s riches . \\n sixthly  i ask that you hand me the weapons of mass destruction if you have found them  bring back to life all the martyrs you have killed  and return the integrity of the glorious iraqi women which you have robbed . \\n rumsfeld : is this some kind of joke ? \\n E2809 E3964 : no  this is just the bitter truth  which you know very well . \\n mr rumsfeld  you have committed the greatest crime in history against a peaceful arab state .. we met each other in the eighties . \\n do you remember your offers ?

[he] makes no sound but [his] tracks are obvious . \\n motaawen@hotmail.com \\n E2809 \\'s last days and what is said [he] was like \\n bu thari \\n what we know about E2809 E3964 in recent years is that [he] had changed a lot . \\n [he] had islamic tendecies and acts which many iraqis mentioned  saying that E2809 supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for memorizing koran  and charities  and the dancer \\'s punishment was death . \\n [he] had many works . \\n but some explained [his] islamic tendency by saying that [he] was currying favor with the sunnis as if they were reading [his] mind . \\n i have followed E2809 E3964  especially in recent years  and i noticed about [him] was that there was religion but there was injustice and coarseness . \\n and [his] punishment was unjust . \\n i mean  for example  the dancer would be killed after second offence . \\n i did not expect anyone to kill the dancer unless good would come of it  but like the most idiots [his] aim was correct but the method was wrong . \\n another example - after [his] son udai harmed the iraqi people and attacked women and other matters  E2809 ordered [him] to be killed . \\n and in fact [he] was fired on but survived miraculously  after being hit with several fatal shots some of which hit [his] spine . \\n this is a sign that there was good in [him] otherwise [he] would not have ordered the killing of [his] son  [his] own child . \\n but [he] was not a scholar nor feared in god . \\n i myself heard from some people who were in iraq about the things that E2809 E3964 used to do  and could not be reasonably done by anyone other than a good moslem to the extent that many said of [his] actions that they were only to gain favor amongst the sunnis and the religious . \\n but we judge by the appearances and [his] end was in line with the appearance . \\n in [his] last days during the fall of baghdad and [his] disappearance  an old woman or man said on tv on al - jazeera channel that [he] was hiding in [her] house and had had [his] prayer mat with [him] and was always praying and reading the koran . \\n do we say no  this is hypocrisy ? \\n E296 in mind that many have said that E2809 prayed regularly especially after [he] was put in prison by the rafida and their masters . \\n some of those who said that [he] was always praying and reading the koran are the christians who visited [him] in [his] prison cell . \\n finally  during [his] hanging  the rafida tried to distract [him] and keep [him] from saying the creed before [his] death . \\n they were trying everything they could but we say that god made [him] steadfast for the whole world to see that [he] died acknowledging god . \\n the rafida were shouting provocative words such as muqtada and al - sadr so that [he] would lose control and curse them  then they would have killed [him] . \\n so they could show the clip in which there is cursing and insults from E2809 and cut the rest . \\n however [he] remained steadfast in saying the creed and was killed whilst saying it . \\n i believe that this could n\\'t have happened without god making [him] steadfast otherwise god would not have made [him] steadfast in it . \\n as one of the sheikhs says  many people when they were supposed to say the creed and were being dictated the creed by those present would murmur  did love see drunkards ?  \\n other people say  i have not said it while i was alive and you want me to say it when i am dying ... the truth is what is apparent . \\n but E2809 E3964 was reasonable in that [he] repented and turned to [his] creator who receives the repentance from [his] slave . \\n and [he] committed himself to the worship of god . and remained loyal to god . \\n i ask god to have mercy on [him] and to forgive [him] and to give [him] an ample dwelling in [his] paradise and guide the rest of the ba\\'thists . \\n the success of al - jazeera and the failure of hebrew  the film  the death squads  for

the role of the shiites in our beloved iraq becomes clearer . \\n the hebrew channel  i meant the E5002 - arabiya channel  did not dare  to broadcast this film or even mention it and the reasons are famously unknown .. \\n this is a unique precedent for al - jazeera .. \\n there are many questions  amongst them the timing of its being shown at this very time  following the conflict in interests between the sons of monkeys and pigs and the sons of temporary marriages ... \\n i leave you with the film which saddens the heart and makes it bleed .... \\n the link to the film .. \\n http://z08.zupload.com/download.php?...filepath=48993 \\n the islam diary : a leader of the shiite death squads in sadr city  east of baghdad  acknowledged that the mahdi army militia was involved in killing operations of arab sunni men after kidnapping them  despite their relatives having paid the blood money demanded by the hostage - takers in return for their being freed . \\n speaking at the same time about an iranian role in the financing and support of the war of genocide against the sunnis .  fadil   a commander in the mahdi army tells how [he] had followed three arab sunni men for a period of some weeks and detained them when they were crossing the karada bridge  after having informed an iraqi army road block close to the area that [he] was pursuing  terrorists   then attacked the car of the group in question . \\n [he] also told the british guardian that [he] took the three men to sadr city where [his] group had interrogated them then executed them  indicating that the members of the mahdi army usually demanded a ransom from the families of the hostages in return for freeing their relatives  and would liquidate them anyway after they receive the ransom . \\n the newspaper quoted another commander in the mahdi army as saying ;  we have taken 10 sunnis hostages  we will get a ransom for five of them  then we will kill them all . in every major hostage - taking operation we get 50 thousand dollars   and [he] considered it to be the best business a person could be running in baghdad now ! \\n the newspaper described  fadil  as a valuable commander to this squad because [he] is a shiite who grew up in the sunni area south of baghdad . \\n [he] speaks in the sunni dialect and carries an identity card from the yusufiyah sunni village . \\n [he] was quoted as saying :  i can enter the sunni areas without anyone knowing that i am a shiite .  \\n it pointed out that fadil and the likes are responsible for the dozens of corpses which are being found daily in baghdad . \\n this means that the baghdad security plan will not be successful unless the americans control squads such as these to put breaks on the civil war . \\n  fadil  was quoted as saying that the mahdi army is resorting in its operations to reinforcements from iraqi army units commanded by its members or sympathizers  and confirmed that all the police belong to the shiite militia . \\n [he] added that the mahdi army is receiving logistic and military support from iran and that they are not encountering any problems in getting weapons through to sadr city because they usually present a letter to each of the checkpoints they pass through . \\n E5875 of the interior \\n  the E5002 - jazeera channel is superior to the E5002 - arabiya in many areas   even though it has some

personal income tax for the country amounted to approximately 181 billion  of which 65 % came from the working class  and only 10 % came from the wealthy . \\n clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on controlling wealth accumulation by the rich  and too little impact on improving the quality of life of wage earners . \\n while this type of tax in china has no effect on regulating the income gap or on  taking from the rich to help the poor   neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class . \\n if this tax continues to be collected  it will be working against the original intention behind the income tax . \\n clearly the necessity for the personal income tax needs to be challenged . \\n i propose eliminating the personal income tax just as the agricultural tax was eliminated  to give people an opportunity to prosper . \\n if we think in terms of humanizing the system  i.e.  helping the poor by letting poor people get rich  we should give low - and moderate - income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives ; the threshold for china \\'s personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month  i.e.  to 6400 yuan per person . \\n that would take it to a minimally humanized level  and then we could really talk about  people first .  \\n with a threshold below this level  the poor will always be poor . \\n yesterday cctv presented a program on adjustment of the personal income tax  emphasized that the main goal of the adjustment was to  take from the rich  and let poor people get wealthy . \\n if we really want to give poor people a chance to get wealthy  the threshold for the personal income tax should be tripled . \\n with anything under this threshold  the poor will have no chance to get rich . \\n and if we \\'re looking at it in terms of  taking from the rich   the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing china \\'s social national income  namely how to eliminate the  unreported income .  \\n the income of the vast majority of china \\'s rich people is unreported income  and unreported income is a problem that chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come ; it is a characteristic of china  an uncontrollable black hole in china \\'s social oversight . \\n this is far from being a tax problem ; it is a deeper systemic problem . \\n if china \\'s personal income tax can not achieve the effect of helping the poor to become rich  neither can it control the excessive incomes of the wealthy  so what is it we expect this personal income tax to do ? \\n it would be better to eliminate it in one fell swoop  as we did with the agricultural tax . \\n below are some of the main reasons : \\n 1. china \\'s income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor ; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat . \\n in china the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state \\'s financial revenues ; it is not to regulate the income gap . \\n in 2004 china \\'s income taxes amounted to approximately 180 billion  accounting for about 6 % of the state \\'s financial revenues . \\n but of this 180 billion  about 65 %  or 117 billion  was paid by the working class . \\n less than 10 % was paid by the wealthy . \\n in china more than 90 % of the people who depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are urban poor . \\n these poor people  who struggle just to pay for the necessities of life  their children \\'s education  old age  illness and death  also have to pay income tax . \\n in all of china \\'s cities now  anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered poor . \\n if a husband and wife have a total monthly work income of 2000 yuan  and if they pay 33 % income tax on anything over 1500 yuan  they have a disposable income of only 1670 yuan . \\n a household like this can not even continue bearing basic living expenses  and their standard of living will decline . \\n and should anyone in the household get sick and have to go to the hospital  the family may well find itself in an economic crisis . \\n and if a family like this wants to buy its own home  that will basically be impossible . \\n and if only one person in a three - person family is employed  the family will have a very difficult life . \\n but even so  they have to pay 165 yuan in income tax . \\n clearly  if our income tax threshold is set at 1500 yuan  our society is destined always to produce a proletariat  always to deny hope to the poor or to the masses of ever getting rich . \\n our production relations are no different from the production relations in marx \\'s  das kapital   constantly reproducing a proletariat who can only rely on selling its labor to make a living . \\n in short  if the personal income tax threshold is set lower than 6400 yuan  it will be ineffective in helping the poor get rich . \\n conversely  if the threshold is too low  it will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability of poor people to get rich . \\n 2. the personal income tax is absolutely unable to control the accumulation of wealth by the rich . \\n we should not entertain any illusions that china \\'s income tax can in any way regulate income distribution  much less that it can  take from the rich and give to the poor .  \\n in chinese society  20 % of the people hold 80 % of social wealth  and 80 % of the people are able to use only 20 % of the social wealth to suffer through their lives . \\n in china  freedom  human rights  democracy  happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer refer only to 20 % of the people . \\n western countries that attack china for not having human rights  democracy and freedom are quite wrong ; these 20 % of upper - class citizens have broader human rights  democracy and freedom than do western societies . \\n when god looks at china  [he] sees only these 20 % ; the other 80 % [he] ca n\\'t see clearly . \\n the income of the vast majority of these 20  of upper - class citizens in china is basically unreported income ; the proportion of their income that comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of their wealth . \\n only if china eliminated unreported income would the income tax have an effect on rich people . \\n and if china wants to eliminate unreported income  to date there is no sign of that  and there is no compelling evidence to explain when china might eliminate unreported income . \\n anyhow  it is not something our generation will see . \\n that is why the income tax has no effect on regulating the wealth of china \\'s rich people . \\n it does however have a highly restrictive effect on the ability of poor people to get rich . \\n a very simple explanation is that poor people are all wage earners who rely on fully declared wages for their living ; they do not have unreported income . \\n fully 100 % of their income falls within the income - tax field of vision  so they ca n\\'t escape even if they wanted to . \\n add to this the fact that the threshold is under the level required to meet the necessary expenditures to maintain the basic necessities of life  and the poor are completely stymied . \\n  dragons give birth to dragons  phoenixes to phoenixes ; the son of a bandit will live in a cave .  \\n  the children of poor people are always poor .  \\n with the previous 800 yuan income tax threshold  if it were strictly enforced  80 % of beggars would have to pay . \\n with a threshold set below 5000 yuan  this generation of poor people need not think about buying a home or driving a car . \\n they will always be poor . \\n of course  many children of poor people are able to get rich  but this came about because the parents struggled harder  tightening their belts and  skimping on food and clothing  for themselves . \\n now how many university students who have received acceptance notifications are unable to enroll  and how many enrolled university students from the countryside have parents who are living through unimaginably hard times ? \\n in western countries  the personal income tax is the most effective means of controlling excessively high incomes among the rich . \\n but these are countries ruled by law  where official income is all recorded  citizen \\'s incomes are fully transparent  and therefore the personal income tax can easily achieve the effect of regulating income distribution . \\n the situation in china is not like that ; if the personal income tax has an effect  it \\'s to increase financial revenues  and it has absolutely no income - regulating effect . \\n 3. eliminating the income tax will benefit peasants . \\n the vast majority of china \\'s 900 million peasants are unable to reach the income level for paying income tax . \\n but the peasants have contractual land  they have a low - consumption rural lifestyle and conditions  and they have basic housing . \\n but if people in the cities do n\\'t have money  everything is a struggle . \\n if they go shopping for food by bike  they have to pay 20 cents for parking . \\n they ca n\\'t not pay the rent or they \\'ll have to sleep on the street . \\n in terms of macroeconomic law  the distribution of wealth in chinese society is set at 2/8  with the 20 % of wealthy people holding 80 % of the social wealth  and the 80 % of poor people holding just 20 % of the social wealth . \\n the personal income tax threshold is too low  the urban population is too large  and the population participating in the 20 % that goes to peasants is even greater  so the peasants ultimately have to get a reduced share of this 20 % . \\n if we eliminate the personal income tax  the number of poor people in the cities will be reduced  and the people participating in the peasant struggle for this 20 % will be reduced  which will benefit the peasants . \\n in china the wealthy will always hold 80 % of the social wealth ; there has never been a softhearted rich person . \\n 4. this will really be beneficial in establishing a soft - landing market economy system . \\n in recent years china \\'s rate of state financial growth has been higher than economic growth ; this is a highly abnormal phenomenon  and in terms of economic theory it is highly adverse for sustained  healthy growth of the national economy . \\n the blood has all been pumped out of the national economy ; it \\'s like eating up all the seeds sown in the spring . \\n the proportion of financial revenues from the personal income tax is about 6 % . \\n if we cancel out this 6 %  we can slow down financial growth . \\n and in the chinese economic cycle  excessive financial investment is not a good thing for economic growth and the establishment of a true market economy system . \\n compared to market investment  the efficiency of financial investment is less than half . \\n and when there is too much financial investment  corruption is everywhere  all the time . \\n 5. it promotes the establishment of a harmonious society . \\n chinese and foreign history amply demonstrates that a harmonious society is an olive - shaped society : the distribution of numbers of poor  middle - class and wealthy people making up the society is small at either end and larger in the middle  with 40 % or more of the society being middle class . \\n chinese society is 80 % poor people  20 % wealthy ; there is no stable middle class  or it floats between the lower levels of the wealthy and the upper end of the poor and is highly unstable . \\n there is no way this  2/8  social structure can establish a harmonious society . \\n eliminating the personal income tax to accumulate wealth for the people will be beneficial in producing and nourishing a middle class and will promote the creation of a harmonious society . \\n in short  if our personal income tax policy can not help the poor get rich  and is unable to limit the excessive increase in wealth among the rich  then it is better not to have this kind of personal income tax . \\n we need to adopt this kind of strategic insight when we consider this matter  so as to benefit the country and the people . \\n this essay is dedicated

18:53:26 -lsb- sms -rsb- -lsb- tables -rsb- . \\n advice to wu jinglian and others : killing the father -- does you no good ! . \\n -- some thoughts on the attitude of benign inheritance towards social reform . \\n a glance at the title  people with a little political sensitivity may roughly understand the core topic of this article : the rule of benign interaction between planned economy and market economy  and between public ownership and private ownership -- because only their relationships are those between a father and a son  and it is only between them are there different conflicts involving  human relations    rules  and  science   as well as bloody wrestling between classes  factions and individuals on the basis of morality and interests . \\n comparing planned economy and public ownership to a father is tantamount to comparing market economy and private ownership to a son  which holds water principally and historically no matter you put it this way or another . \\n this is because the former two given  fatherhood  are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new china  while the latter two dubbed  son  in this article -- are indeed the ideological outcomes derived after the death of china \\'s founder comrade E2623 zedong under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership  which grew into today \\'s para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up . \\n regarding this  the factual development process of political civilization that the marxist ideology has been increasingly marginalized over the past 30 years or so is a strong evidence . \\n by sorting out the essence of the above historical background and conceptual relationships  we will have a pretty thorough  comprehensive and systematic knowledge framework about the benign inevitable trends and development guidelines of the future society dependent on the rule of society  so that the associated impression captured may be more concrete . \\n regarding this  my standpoint is : because the socialism underpinned by planned economy  public ownership and the people \\'s democratic dictatorship is indeed a really  fresh  systemic thing for china in the mid and late 20th century -- without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to  no matter how scientific its kernel is  it is hard not to have certain superficial and local problems . \\n however  this should not provide an excuse to overthrow it by fair means or foul  as [he] is our father and the common choice of millions of laboring people . \\n the fact that it  finally became our national character and main system after over half a century of international and domestic political transformation  is a stronger proof that it is the milestone for a new civilization resulted from the blood and sweat of thousands of proletarian revolutionary martyrs . \\n therefore  no matter from the perspective of average citizens or from the standpoint of the founder of the new government  we should respect and develop [her] on the basis of inheritance  innovation and improvement . \\n is my opinion above correct ? \\n i believe you will naturally obtain a relatively fair and just conclusion if you could understand and treat the above - mentioned  father  system and  son  system with impartiality and sufficient goodwill . \\n for example  based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history  we could see : the  father  system mentioned herein has the majority in mind or it is established in the fundamental and long - term interests of the majority  as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of the country  the nation  and the overall society -- while the  son  system mentioned herein is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation  fraudulence  pernicious influence and robbery . \\n so  we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific  father  system by fair mean or foul without considering the consequences  because there are problems in its practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales  lower efficiency due to centralized management  and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal . \\n it is because that will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as it violates the rule of benign social development  distorts normal  human relations  and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted in it  but the humanity will retrogress as people \\'s thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous . \\n yes  this is the case . \\n my opinion above is not absurd and delusive at all  because this is true not only in theory  but also to the rule of social development as demonstrated by historical facts  as well as from the perspective of the situation and reality of the country : none of the current  advocates of market economy  private ownership and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie  has established and proposed a new deal  against planned economy  public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat .  \\n all their criticisms are directed at the developmental symptoms such as  lower efficiency due to centralized management  or  inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal   all their proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed to win over the less than 5 %  vested interests   and their development logic asks the  95 %  laboring people to stay where they are and willingly endure the hard work -- it speaks for itself how empty  ridiculous  sick  ignorant and anti-government it is . \\n that \\'s why i want to say to the world and the age by the end of the article : when the father \\'s toes are injured  we should try our best to treat the foot problem  and open up a new life and embrace health in the principle of respecting human relations  obeying people \\'s wishes  conforming to science and carrying on the legacy -- if the present capitalist followers frantically urge the son to kill [him] by all means  the result could only be a tragedy ! \\n and these happen to be the core of the destiny where the capitalist roaders  will inevitably bury themselves due to their ignorance and insanity  and more or less harm the human society !  \\n at last  i would like to admonish sincerely and earnestly those who blindly oppose  hate and even suppress planned economy  public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat  especially the  mainstream elite scholars  including wu jinglian  who insist on smearing the  father  to the end : do not treat the  fathers  on which the new civilization is based barbarously  against your conscience and frantically for immediate gains . \\n the result is definitely a tragedy -- because even if you kill the  father   your felony will be disdained by the age and condemned by the people  which naturally leads to nothing good ! \\n independent economic

22:51:46 2007 -rrb- . \\n i have deep feelings and a lot of sympathy with the author after reading the article breakneck 90 m/h on a snowy night . \\n it also reminds me of something that i experienced several years ago  also related to an airport and meeting people . \\n a couple of years ago  my neighbor approached me to borrow my car  saying [he] was meeting [his] parents at the airport . \\n [he] also said both [his] wife and children wanted to go . \\n as [his] car was too small and mine was big  it could make [his] parents more comfortable . \\n [he] added that [he] would only use it for one morning and would return it to me before noon . \\n although there was only a nodding acquaintance between the neighbor and me  we lived in the same apartment building after all and were both chinese . \\n so i discussed with my wife back home and lent [him] the car as we thought we would not be using the car until the same afternoon . \\n and then something happened ... \\n at 1:00pm  the neighbor called me  saying [he] took [his] parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm . \\n i of course agreed and asked them not to rush . \\n this wait lasted till 5:30pm  when the neighbor told me in a half - crying tone that there was an accident  and everyone else was intact  except [his] father  who was in hospital for fractures . \\n i comforted [him] first and asked my friend to rush me to the hospital . \\n my neighbor showed me the police report at the hospital  which indicated it was all my neighbor \\'s fault . \\n [he] clashed into a truck going straight when [he] made a left turn . \\n my car was completely damaged and had been towed away . \\n i forced myself to refrain from the grief of loosing my beloved car -lrb- mine was liability - only coverage -rrb- and asked the friend to send their family home . \\n and then the nightmare began . \\n the next day  my neighbor called me  saying [his] father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from \\n i told [him] part would be covered by my car insurance . \\n after a while  [he] called again  saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford \\n i tried my best to comfort [him] then and told [him] to think of a way slowly \\n just then  a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line  saying [her] family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this . \\n [she] also said my car was a japanese one  which had poor safety performance and it was my car to blame for the car accident . \\n [she] added that i should pay the money because the car was mine . \\n i hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on . \\n my wife -lsb- pw% -rsb- had been persuading me aside  saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury . \\n [she] asked me to take no heed of them and let them calm down first . \\n so i did n\\'t take their words seriously but still felt angry . \\n out of my expectation  a phone call on the third day completely changed my original idea . \\n the telephone rang just as i was about to go to work in the morning . \\n i thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily . \\n unexpectedly  coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man . \\n [he] said in an incontestable tone that my neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my car  which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests  and as the car owner  they would not sue me if i compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -lrb- three times -rrb-  otherwise they would see me in court . \\n [he] added that [he] was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation [he] requested could double in court . \\n as a great chinese guy  how could i be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ? \\n i also took up the weapon of law for justice . \\n of course  i also retained a lawyer . \\n out of my expectation  my lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls . \\n one was to the police station  asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident . \\n there was additional findings unexpectedly  which were against them . \\n someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station . \\n the police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch . \\n the second call was to their lawyer . \\n so their lawyer dropped the lawsuit . \\n of course  they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me several times  sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening . \\n the most classic one was : do n\\'t ever dream of living a life back to china  as we have people across the country . \\n disgusting ! \\n here comes the old topic again  are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks . \\n i think many people will say they wo n\\'t . \\n i would suggest not to lend online . \\n however  the internet is after all virtual . \\n words sometimes have no emotions . \\n when your seemingly nice neighbor  seemingly close friend  or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world  how many people will answer with a  no ?  \\n anyhow  i was not able to do that . \\n i lent my car to some people in need after that  and i believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple . \\n in conclusion  here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : . \\n our side : a 02 camary of 50 miles  retaining fee 200 . annual leave two days . \\n their side : one leg of the father -lrb- repaired -rrb-  hospital charge : unknown  costs for missing work hours : unknown  retaining fee : unknown . \\n and most importantly : the dignity and honor of the entire family -lrb- except children -rrb- . \\n -- \\n * source : · bbs unknown space http://mitbbs.com · -lsb- from : 129.137. -rsb- . \\n i thank my

to find a job within a month to keep myself going . \\n now in this month with the christmas holiday there \\'s really only three weeks of actual work time  and i do n\\'t think any companies are going to be hiring people during this period . \\n despair  that sinking feeling weighing on my mind  so much pressure i could n\\'t eat  could n\\'t sleep ; i was simply going crazy . \\n but i still needed to do something ; getting crazy - hysteric makes no sense . \\n then i started connecting with my friends in america ; i went to maimaiti to ask for help  consulted about my status  and looked for a way to solve the problem . \\n even my relatives \\' friends in america and my parents \\' friends all got involved . \\n friends  it \\'s always friends who help me at key moments . \\n many friends got people they knew to recommend me  help me send out resumes  or call and commiserate with me . \\n there was one friend who had just got an offer  but [he] did n\\'t want to go  so [he] recommended me to go for [him]  but it was way off in la  plus the salary was n\\'t ideal  but at least it could help me keep the legal status  so i thought i would take it . \\n after the telephone interview  i flew to la  landing at 12:00 noon  and at 4:00 p.m. . \\n i had the interview . \\n by then 17 - 18 hours had passed since i \\'d gotten up at 4:00 a.m. \\n although i was too tired to walk  i still had to pump up my spirits so i \\'d be in peak form for the interview . \\n the interview did n\\'t last long  just two hours and it was over . \\n i felt the interview went well  and started to feel confident . \\n but on that day one senior level person was n\\'t there  so the next day early i had to go back to talk to [him] . \\n so the next day i got up at 7:00 and ran over to chat for an hour ; that guy was nice  did n\\'t embarrass me  so after an hour it ended happily . \\n after that the boss took me to the home office  and on the way [he] gave me an oral offer  and [he] said it would not be easy for me to come right away  that i should do the physical exam immediately and do all the paperwork  wait until after new year \\'s  and the hr director would return and turn in the h1 . \\n then i went straight for the physical  and i filled out the application form  reference list  etc. \\n at 3:00 p.m.  the dust finally settled . \\n finally before christmas i received a christmas present . \\n although i still have n\\'t made the final decision to go  at least i have a guaranteed - minimum choice . \\n so i am thanking everyone for helping me . \\n i hope that all my friends who are still looking for work will be able to find their ideal job in the new year . \\n -- \\n * source : ・ bbs unnamed space station http://mitbbs.com ・ -lsb- from : 72.224. -rsb- . \\n guo E2193 \\'s economic notes : beijing \\'s gas E5191 vs. us gas E5191 \\n guo E2193 \\'s economic notes \\n in the us the current average price of regular unleaded gas is about 2.3 us dollars per gallon -lrb- 3.78 liters -rrb- . \\n according to the official exchange rate of one us dollar for 7.9 rmb  this price is equivalent to 4.80 yuan / liter . \\n note  this gas price includes all taxes . \\n the current gas price in beijing is 5.09 yuan / liter  2 mao and 9 fen more than in the us . \\n in fact  the gas price difference between the two places is larger than 2 mao and 9 fen because china \\'s gas price does not include so many taxes as in the us ; for example  the highway maintenance fee in china is paid separately . \\n just now  i only narrated a fact . \\n but i believe that different persons see different problems in this fact . \\n let me describe people \\'s two reactions that i can imagine  or the two problems i can see . \\n 1. the us gas price is too cheap . \\n in an absolute sense  the us gas price has +already been cheaper than china \\'s  and in a relative sense  the us gas price is even cheaper . \\n in the us  the money you pay for a meal at mcdonald \\'s can fill up more than 10 liters of gas  but in beijing you can get 5 - 6 liters of gas at most . \\n the us low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country \\'s excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources . \\n however  there is more to this matter  the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the us excessive energy consumption : global warming  and wars caused by oil  etc. \\n it is totally a joke that the us gas price could be cheaper than china \\'s . \\n 2. china \\'s gas price is too expensive . \\n both americans and chinese buy gas from the international market  and the technology and cost of oil refinement are not too much different . \\n but with the us gas price including taxes even lower than china \\'s gas price excluding taxes  you can see how much money chinese oil companies have made out of this . \\n if there are no price controls and monopolies  china \\'s gas price should n\\'t have been this high . \\n i want to say that i think these two opinions are both correct . \\n so  on the issue of oil consumption  i think china and the us  the no. 1 and no. 2 oil consumers in the world  are also a funny pair . \\n from a global perspective  the us gas price is obviously too low . \\n so mankiw at E5835 even formed a  pigou club   gathering social celebrities who support levying higher taxes on gas prices -lrb- hereby raising gas prices -rrb- . \\n china \\'s gas prices are more complicated . \\n in fact  gas prices in china are probably not very high  but in order to reduce china \\'s future overdependence on gas  it may be better that china \\'s gas prices are higher . \\n but  the direct result of the gas price increase in china will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies . \\n this part of money will not become the government tax revenue  will not be used for public welfare  and on the contrary  will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better . \\n in other words  the gas price in china is too high in the distributive sense . \\n it is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people . \\n but in terms of sustainability  china \\'s gas price may still be too low . \\n we need high gas prices to control the overdependence on energy imports . \\n perhaps someone will condemn me  saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people . \\n if you are a taxi driver  my reply is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price  but because of our taxi licensing regulation system . \\n if you are a car owner  my reply is : ride the subway and bus more often . \\n it saves money  reduces congestion  and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say  life is unbearable .  \\n compared with most people  your life is already quite good . \\n darling0823 \\n comparing mcdonald \\'s in the us with mcdonald \\'s in china may not be right . \\n eating a meal at mcdonald \\'s in the us is more comparable to buying a 5 - yuan boxed meal in china . \\n so i work in that same beauty salon  \\n i \\'m chained to the old masquerade \\n the lipstick  the shadow  the silicone : \\n i follow my father \\'s trade - \\n E1846 cohen \\n E5324 E5548 may be another example of a celebrity distraction which  upon examination  reveals more about our society \\'s mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine . \\n almost certainly more than it would dare to describe . \\n yesterday  E5548 was ordered to close neverland for having failed to pay the ranch \\'s 47 employees their salary or insurance since the end of 2005 . \\n unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise . \\n [he] \\'s moved on since [his] aquittal  like E7512 glitter did after [his] 1999 conviction  having departed last E2265 for a bahrain `` vacation \\'\\' from which [he] \\'s yet to emerge . \\n -lrb- \\'\\' for the people working at bahrain \\'s malls  the person covered head to toe in a black veil  gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich  doting saudi mother .... \\n but why would a woman wear a man \\'s shoes ? \\n why the bodyguards ? \\n and why did the person \\'s fluid movements seem so familiar ? \\'\\' -rrb- \\n last week \\'s real E5548 story ran in the new york daily news  under the snappy banner `` creepy dad was root of all clan \\'s woe  singer sez . \\'\\' \\n the singer was brother E2788  and the claims based on the projected outline for [his] abandoned `` tell - all \\'\\' family story . \\n reading that E6315 was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards [his] daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses \\'\\' moment . \\n what \\'s new is this : \\n E2788 even suggested [his] father may have set up E5324 to be somehow victimized by older men . \\n [he] tells how [his] father would have E5324 join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people  \\'\\' and wondered whether `` something happened \\'\\' to E5324 at those sessions . \\n [he] said [he] sensed something was wrong because E5324 would be sick for days after . \\n `` what was E6315 doing ? \\'\\' E2788 wrote . \\n this lifts the E5548 family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction  one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege . \\n this should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller  passing [his] child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status  protection and reward . \\n all that \\'s missing is the element of occult terror . \\n or maybe not : `` latoya also described being awakened in the night by E6315 wearing a \\' monster mask . \\' \\'\\' \\n perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the E5548 clan had gotten with the program . \\n perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . \\n -lrb- this is how i tend to think of ponchatoula \\'s hosanna church . -rrb- \\n yet we should n\\'t discount the suspicion  either  particularly given some of E5324 \\'s paranormal interests and peculiar associations . \\n [his] close friendship with spectra contactee and channeller of the nine  E1040 geller  for one instance . \\n -lrb- E5548 was geller \\'s best man in 2001 when [he] and [his] wife renewed [his] vows  the same year geller is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . -rrb- \\n [his] entourage including a `` personal magician \\'\\' for another . \\n even if you wanted to  you wo n\\'t be reading E2788 \\'s account now . \\n like every E5548 sibling who \\'s tried to break from E1048  [he] \\'s climbed down  returned to the fold and scrapped the book  apparently on the strength of E5324 \\'s threats to sue . \\n previously  E5324 \\'s given cause for family observers to attribute [his] grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling [his] father . \\n yet there they were at E5548 \\'s trial last year  hand in hand . \\n in the big picture E5324 E5548 means not very much . \\n but [his] little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests . \\n good stuff . \\n having departed last E2265 for a bahrain `` vacation \\'\\' from which [he] \\'s yet to emerge . \\n actually  there have been reports for the past two days of E5548 back in california . \\n #name ? \\n wild wild stuff E285 ! \\n disinformation

of rights . \\n the fellowship  also known as the international foundation  bought the property from E6289 piluso . \\n although not much is known about piluso  the los angeles times reported that E3713 hughes  the man with whom fellowship senator E1082 E6810 E1456 once sparred  also lived there . \\n according to a senior pentagon official  the cedars had been used as a cia safe house prior to the fellowship \\'s purchase of the estate . \\n the fellowship paid $ 1.5 million for the cedars  the money coming from E6408 phillips  the ceo of raytheon  and E6694 olsen  the ceo of digital equipment corporation . \\n E2160 mcdonnell of mcdonnell E2425 corporation was another deep - pocketed supporter of the fellowship through full gospel business men \\'s fellowship international  an activity linked to fellowship core member E2515 robertson . \\n suffer the little children  eh ? \\n if this is what power & wealth does to you  i \\'m damn glad i have neither . \\n you said  `` perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . \\'\\' \\n could n\\'t agree more . \\n i think that pedophilia \\'s relative commonality is what really makes it frightening . \\n my experience happened when i was 15 . \\n a friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink . \\n we were both enamored with kerouac & E1796 morrison & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill . \\n [he] was muscle for a pittsburgh madam named tex E462 . \\n [she] dressed like a man & ran most of the massage parlors in pgh . \\n [he] was into black magick & crowley & booze & drugs & on & on . \\n so  one night  we \\'re at [his] apartment  drunk out of our minds  \\n & my buddy passes out . \\n i continue drinking . \\n at one point  i glance at this older guy  \\n & [he] is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in [his] mouth & drips on to the floor . \\n i think  \\' what the fuck ? \\' \\n but i \\'m pretty goddamn wasted \\n & reality is having a helluva time penetrating the fog in my head . \\n [he] notices that i \\'m kind of staring at [him] . \\n [he] stands up  walks into the bedroom  & comes back with a porno mag . \\n [he] drops it on the couch next to me . \\n as [he] \\'s sitting down  [he] says  `` E5763 anything you like ? \\'\\' \\n & then [he] shoves [his] hand hard into my groin ..... \\n .... & i broke [his] nose with my elbow . \\n make no mistake though  up till that point  the guy scared the shit out of me . \\n but  lucky for me  my reaction was see red anger instead of cowering fear . \\n after i hit [him]  i jumped up  ran into [his] kitchen & grabbed a big old butcher knife  ran back into the room & proceeded to kick my buddy into consciousness & drag [his] comatose ass the hell out of there . \\n now  for me  the interesting part happened years later . \\n at the time  my buddy & i were selling things . \\n my buddy had a real good supplier for these things but it was [his] secret . \\n at one point  my buddy could n\\'t pick up the shipment so i had to go . \\n before i left  [he] had to explain to me that [his] supplier was none other than E5764 feelup . \\n i decided to go . \\n [he] was now closer to 40 & just a hollow shell of [his] former self . \\n friendless  [his] only company being neighborhood teens looking to party . \\n [he] kept one room empty except for 4 black candles in each of its corners . \\n [he] would read curses aimed at people who pissed [him] off . \\n really pathetic . \\n about a year later  a few of those teens took an intense dislike to E5764 & the beat [him] to to death . \\n i ca n\\'t imagine why . \\n can you ? \\n i apologize for continuing my ramble but ...  \\n ... i do n\\'t know how you folks would classify pedophilia . \\n maybe a 30 year old man & a 15 year old boy does n\\'t qualify . \\n i wonder about that myself  but i have to say that when i was 30  i was n\\'t plying 15 year old girls with booze & copping feels . \\n i \\'ll shut up now . \\n speaking of E2515 robertson - \\n i remembered something about [him] being linked with E6148 bout and the uae two - step currently going on : \\n bout was liberian dictator E6289 E547 \\'s primary arms and diamond smuggler ... \\n E547  who is now in exile in nigeria  was a business partner with E3174 coalition founder E2515 robertson ... in a cayman islands front company called freedom gold  ltd . \\n in fact  freedom gold was headquartered at robertson \\'s cbn offices in E3957 beach  E3957 . \\n robertson \\'s african interests also crossed paths with bout \\'s in another country -- the former zaire . \\n robertson \\'s african development company used the cover of robertson \\'s tax - exempt `` operation blessing \\'\\' to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war - ravaged zaire -lrb- now congo -rrb- . \\n one of bout \\'s many assets is new millennium air company of gambia . \\n the director of this firm is `` baba jobe \\'\\' . \\n -lrb- hmmm - \\n `` baba \\'\\' ... -rrb- \\n http://www.analystnewspaper.com/ameu_scam_feb21.html \\n http://www.waynemadsenreport.com/ \\n http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/wanted/2005/1212ties.htm \\n my question is  when is a victim guilty of abuse ? \\n E5548 is definitely a mind - control  sra victim . \\n [he] \\'s programmed . \\n neverland sounds like a cryptic command from mkultra wizard of oz programming . \\n the bizarre from black - to - white and physical transformation must be the result of biotech advances . \\n if [he] does abuse \\' [his] \\' children  is [he] \\' guilty \\' as such if [he] is programmed ? \\n i suspect [he] is a brilliant cover or red - herring used as a shield by very powerful forces  responsible for god - knows - what at [his] now - abandoned ranch . \\n it \\'s very effective  as many \\' feel \\' that whilst mj is naive [he] \\'s not capable of the evil associated with pedophile activity . \\n this may not be the case  as the public \\' persona \\' is merely an \\' alter \\' personality and [he] may have many other \\' personalities \\' which are dark . \\n then comes the question whether [his] programmers were programmed themselves . \\n if so  then they are all guilty of such abuse  whilst being innocent at the same time ! \\n as most abuse is generational  the whole mind - control subject really has to be brought out in the open . \\n the very technology and tools used on the mind which harm can then be used to heal . \\n brr  pied E1540 . \\n i remember being spooked by that story as a kid . \\n heck of a story to tell children . \\n talking about strange coincidences ... i was trying to write a science fiction story a while back involving E7343 gate type research . \\n i was looking for a cool name for an undercover x-files type military - occult agency . \\n thought of \\' spectre \\' but that seemed too E2691 bondish  and modified it to \\' spectra \\' . \\n thinking rainbow - type symbology . \\n then i find out that \\' spectra \\' is actually a name with significance in the community . \\n what the ... \\n ... of course  i did read a lot of weird stuff in passing as a kid  \\n it \\'s certainly possible that i came across it and forgot . \\n i was n\\'t consciously aware of it  certainly . \\n it \\'s the most disappointingly *cheesy* 1960s sci - fi kind of name for an astral entity to use  that \\'s for sure . \\n i never did write that story . \\n is n\\'t E5324 E5548  and the entire E5548 clan  jehovah \\'s witness ? \\n there was no mention made of this in either the main post or comments .... \\n it would seem to me that their must be some relationship between that cult organization and all the `` high weirdness \\'\\' going on .... \\n no ? \\n .... and it is a cult . \\n fbi finally releases report on missing children . \\n agency unveils surprising statistics : about one - third of lost kids are black \\n -- ap \\n since 1985 nearly 13 million children missing -lrb- those reported -rrb- . \\n an average of 615 per year since 1985 . 791 in 1995 alone . \\n this is an extraordinary group here . \\n i appreciate your candor and your capacity to build a knowledge base with each contributor adding to the thread that moves me in a sonambulant noiseless rush toward the truth . \\n we are living the dieing \\n and that is just as productive and rewarding as any other dimension of spirit that i have experienced \\n if there is just one thing that disappoints me it is that all of the posters here prefer to be anonymous . \\n it would be wise for you to `` be \\'\\' yourself . \\n i tried to

invite you to participate in fshod if that is not too much to ask . \\n maybe we remain anonymous in preparation for the future . \\n i \\'m surprised i have n\\'t heard this mentioned anywhere before  as it ties in perfectly with E285 \\'s bizarro jacko tabloid post : \\n in an interview with blender -lrb- ca n\\'t remember what issue  but E7224 \\'s on the cover -rrb-  E7224 talks at length about

calls `` strawberry  \\'\\' who is geared towards explicit sexual activities . \\n as i understand  this is a classic alters description . \\n a real man would at least let a former board member be able to read the reason [he] had been banned  but  i forgot i was dealing with a coward ! \\n antiaristo will be disappointed  or has [he] already been banned  too ??? \\n a coward dies a thousand

E4913 . \\n the quote below is from the larouchies -- and thus  as always  not to be considered 100 % reliable -- \\n but in this case it fits in so well with the ongoing discussion that i \\'m tentatively inclined to trust it : \\n delay \\'s career and power became at the same time a central project for all three of the shadow partners  E6105 norquist  E6876 abramoff and E1082 E874 . \\n delay was by no means a random point of interest . \\n E6408 delay staggered into E4477 as a freshman congressman in 1984  a terrible drunk  [his] life dissolving . \\n rep. E2204 E3629 -lrb- r - va. -rrb- approached [him] with a road to salvation . \\n [he] reportedly showed delay a videotape that made [him] weep . \\n E6408 delay then radically changed [his] life  turning [his] soul over to higher powers . \\n but by all reliable accounts  delay became a much nastier  a fearsomely un-christian individual . \\n E2204 E3629 represented an old `` black operations \\'\\' soul - robbing agency known as the fellowship foundation . \\n practicing secrecy on about the same level as the national security agency  the fellowship does conduct one public function -- \\n it runs the huge annual congressional / presidential prayer breakfast in E4477  with similar events managed inside the pentagon and at other government and military sites . \\n the fellowship foundation -lrb- earlier called international E3174 leadership and a succession of cover names -rrb- was created before world war ii by the organization of the pro-nazi E2204 buchman . \\n sen. h. E2734 E3060 -lrb- r - n.j. -rrb-  buchman \\'s lieutenant who in 1940 had called for a joint world dictatorship of the united states  britain  and nazi germany  brought the fellowship into acceptance in E4477 . \\n in the 1950s  the group was sponsored by former nazi ss officer  holland \\'s E6866 E12  and the dutch royal family . \\n the fellowship runs a house near the u.s. capitol  where congressmen and senators  who are members  live . \\n for example  sen. E916 brownback -lrb- r - kans. -rrb-  the delirious end - timer  has lived in the cult \\'s house in E4477 . \\n raytheon ceo E6408 phillips and other figures in the military - industrial complex  pay the bills . \\n the fellowship specializes in taking over the lives of potentially powerful individuals who have become somehow ruined  and promising them dominion in the world if they will play along . \\n watergate dirty - trickster E6289 colson  when [he] was on [his] way to prison and suddenly powerless  was recruited  and turned [his] life over to the fellowship . \\n colson \\'s prison fellowship ministries is a subordinate unit of the cult  with its tentacles in most prisons in the united states . \\n after E6408 delay was zapped  E6289 colson became delay \\'s personal guru . \\n colson \\'s militancy for the end - times war on muslims has made [him] a congenial companion to E6876 abramoff in their keeping of delay -- abramoff has repeatedly led E6408 to E7074 to call for all - out war against the arabs . \\n and E3174 coalition co-founder E2515 robertson was himself a product of the fellowship magic . \\n robertson was the good - for - nothing playboy son of sen. a. E7090 robertson -lrb- r - va. -rrb-  the chairman of the senate finance committee . \\n E2515 began speaking in tongues and uttering prophecies under the guidance of E685 bredesen  a master training agent of the fellowship group  who had proved himself to the highest circles of british intelligence . \\n E2515 robertson started off as assistant pastor to bredesen  whose intelligence partners  the full gospel businessmen \\'s fellowship  raised the money to expand robertson \\'s and bredesen \\'s E3957 - based E3174 broadcasting network -lrb- cbn -rrb- toward global power status . \\n the sentence i put in boldface is *extremely* interesting . \\n was n\\'t there a E5324 E5548 video where [he] was envisioning himself as ruler of the world or some such ? \\n to anonymous 9:30 re cults : \\n `` the reason fear can arise so strongly is that you already have a very strong experience of being brainwashed and used in cultish behavior . \\n this cult is called society and its \\' cult - ure \\' gives rise to suffering . \\n if you look closely  everything that is associated with cult behavior can lisewise be found in society \\'s behavior . \\n the same means of control are used : the constant reinforcement that you are helpless without society  that you can not survive without obeying its rules and that you will go to hell if you do n\\'t obey the tenets of its religion . \\'\\' \\n -- gangaji \\n this site monitors E7224 E5548 weight ! \\n http://www.egotastic.com/entertainment/celebrities/janet-jackson/janet-jackson-is-too-fat-to-sing \\n anonymous one  i recall reading somewhere that E5013 E4427 was a member of l.ron \\'s cult . \\n you will notice that E5324 \\'s real troubles started after [he] suied sony chief E1727 mattola  who was heard to say `` [he] \\'ll live to regret the day \\'\\' . \\n do n\\'t ever think of fucken with the evil bastards in the music biz  later . \\n here \\'s a description of that E5324 E5548 item i was remembering : \\n by the time the release of 1995 \\'s history album -- a double album of greatest hits and new tracks -- approached  E5324 had fully realized a new perception of himself  one that was truly larger than life . \\n history was hyped with a four - minute teaser video . \\n this extravagant production begins with a colossal army goose - stepping through a european city in crisp  tan uniforms  waving red flags and sporting red - and - black insignias . \\n military music pounds . \\n crowds swell at the sidelines  screaming and crying . \\n the implication seems to be these men represent nazis . \\n but then  their leader is revealed to be E5324  marching right up front . \\n when peasant workers break free to touch E5324  they are immediately swallowed by soldiers . \\n suddenly  it is night  and a tarp - covered  skyscraper - sized structure looms over the poor nation as choppers spray spotlights across it . \\n brainwashed fans scream  salute with one arm and light candles with religious zeal . \\n signs proclaiming `` E6623 of pop  \\'\\' a title E5324 disavowed to E7524 only two years earlier  are everywhere  emphasizing the word `` E6623 . \\'\\' \\n finally  the tarp drops  and it is  of course  a gargantuan  bronze statue of E5324  fists clenched defiantly  [his] star insignia prominent  yet [his] face still somehow child - like and unthreatening . \\n the video is a highly disturbing piece of work . \\n [his] bloated sense of importance is not only chilling  it is threatening . \\n suddenly  E5324 \\'s perfect world of oz / neverland is forced to be compared with an aryan nation  one that substitutes children for hitler \\'s master race . \\n large image of the E5324 E5548 history statue . \\n there is some sort of an emblem with a star on [his] shoulder  but it \\'s at an angle and not easy to make out clearly . \\n \\'\\' ... a haughty spirit goeth before a fall . \\'\\' \\n btw - and off topic : \\n check out this superb psyop image . \\n E285  i do n\\'t think even you could do better than this : \\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11800917/ \\n remember who E7224 shared the stage with at the superbowl ?

-rrb- \\n i \\'d watch the E3520 pan speculations  unless you know what versions you are discussing and can differentiate between them accurately . \\n some of the assumptions i \\'ve seen -lrb- such as a couple made by E2303 boucher and fantastic planet in last year \\'s postings linked here -rrb- may have looked like they worked to support their thesis  but in actuality have either a tenuous or no connection to the core E3520 pan mythos . \\n do n\\'t make up things like E3520 abducting children that you ca n\\'t substantiate . \\n E3520 pan was a work in progress for jm E6997  who kept tinkering with it over the years . \\n to understand what it actually means to E5324 E5548 and what you might speculate [he] is enacting  you have to know where on the continuum of E3520 pans [his] internalized E3520 -lrb- no  not that kind of peter -rrb- lies . \\n novel  play ? \\n musical  cartoon ? \\n E1539 of a shadow of a remembered story ? \\n in one of the oldest versions  E3520 pan in kensington gardens -lrb- extracted from the little white E2872 -rrb-  is only a week old . \\n [he] escaped from [his] home when [he] was seven days old because [he] remembered how [he] could fly when [he] was a bird before [he] was a human  \\n and that wildness is still in [him]  as it is with all children . \\n E6997 \\'s only cryptic instructions on character development to E3429 boucicault  the first actress to play E3520  was that [she] was to remember that E3520 is a bird  and is one day old . \\n in kensington gardens [he] watches out for children who have fallen un-noticed out of their perambulators . \\n if a bad fairy finds them  or they perish from the cold an dark overnight in the park  E3520 digs them graves and makes them headstones . \\n in E3520 and E7046  the lost boys are the ones who fall out of their perambulators when their nurse is not looking . \\n if they are not claimed in seven days  `` they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses . \\'\\' \\n a far cry from the stealing of children . \\n E3520 and the lost boys crave a mother to tell them stories . \\n it \\'s ironic that while their own lives are far more exotic than the fairy tales E7046 tells  it \\'s those fictions that they want  told by a mother . \\n E6997 says quite explicitly in E3520 and E7046 that it is E7046 who does the tempting to keep E3520 with [her]  not the other way around . \\n it is [she] who asks if E5324 and E719 could come too . \\n if those of you with the abduction theory would like to give specific quotes and information on where it is shown that E3520 abducted the children  please do . \\n but i think you are making it up from a version that does n\\'t exist in reality  or that ca n\\'t be tied to E5324 E5548 . \\n we do n\\'t gain better understanding of the inner workings of E5324 E5548 by distorting the material on which we purportedly base our theories . \\n E285 - i just have to say that i love the rigorous intuition live365 channel . \\n i \\'ve been listening to it to the last couple of days and just bought E58 \\'s \\' oh E5136 \\' . \\n how does the copyright thing work on a live365 stream ?

[SEP]  we 've got to figure this out /.  [SEP]  well just to clarify uh [she] did ultimately uh testify about [her] confidential source /.

[SEP]  E3873 freeh says that when E6074 met with crown E6866 E1383 in nineteen ninety - eight  [he] did n't press for fbi access to suspects in the khobar towers bombing and [he] hit up the prince for a contribution to [his] presidential library /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  and my problem with sixty minutes is that they never called anybody at the meeting /.  [SEP]  until friday afternoon we did n't even know the charge was being made /.  [SEP]  and even then they were unwilling to put somebody on the air to contradict mister freeh /.  [SEP]  sixty minutes says E5515 E6074 was offered a chance to come on and give [his] rebuttal /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  what 's wrong with that /?  [SEP]  well first of all it 's absolutely amazing that sixty minutes thinks it 's okay to air a false and malicious statement /.  [SEP]  this is a terrible charge that an fbi investigation was thwarted because president E6074 wanted to receive money for [his] library /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  the charge was false /.  [SEP]  and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the united states /?  [SEP]  what about anybody at the meeting who was willing to be on /?  [SEP]  what about them doing reporting themselves before they air a false and demonstrably false charge /?  [SEP]  that 's my problem /.  [SEP]  what about E5808 berger the former national security advisor under president E6074 /?  [SEP]  [he] was at the meeting /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [he] was in the room /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  did you offer [him] for an on - camera interview /?  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  it 's not enough to have E3873 freeh say something is so based on an anonymous source /.  [SEP]  that 's poor journalism /.  [SEP]  on that point let me read a statement from a sixty minutes spokesman /.  [SEP]  and this involves uh their saying that they contacted E6074 's office back in E4684 with a detailed list of charges and then quote in subsequent phone calls the president 's people said [he] did not want to be interviewed /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  they gave no +substantive response to any of the allegations until E5749 E2797 launched [his] pr campaign on the thursday before the broadcast and offered himself as the person from the camp who would merely disparage and attack freeh rather than deal with [his] allegations /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  denials from president E6074 and E5808 berger that did deal with freeh 's allegations were included in the sixty minutes report /.  [SEP]  well first of all it 's false to say that i was asking to disparage freeh /.  [SEP]  i was asking to talk about facts that freeh was saying that were not true /.  [SEP]  you do n't mind disparaging freeh /.  [SEP]  my observation /.  [SEP]  no in fact i disparage any man who as fbi director has a personal pique rather than doing [his] job /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  they never talked to mister freeh /.  [SEP]  and in fact it was n't until that friday that we learned the substance of mister freeh 's charges /.  [SEP]  so sixty minutes i think has just said something that is false /.  [SEP]  when did the E6074 team find out that sixty minutes was going to report that E3873 freeh with [his] new book was going to have a specific allegation about E6074 's handling of the khobar towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  when somebody named E3713 kurtz wrote a story in the E4477 post on friday morning is the first time that the E6074 forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that mister freeh made a false charge /.  [SEP]  and even since that interview mister freeh has backed off and has not told people who [his] source is /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  and [he] has n't even insisted that it was true /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [he] just said somebody told [him] it was true /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  president E6074 at that uh meeting did press the uh crown E6866 to cooperate with the fbi /.  [SEP]  so what mister freeh said was false /.  [SEP]  that was not understood by the E6074 people until it was read in the E4477 post in the story that you wrote because sixty minutes put a press release out /.  [SEP]  uh now look E5749 E2797 sixty minutes gave E5515 E6074 one hour last year to push [his] own ten million dollar autobiography /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] criticized people /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] criticized E6694 E93 /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  they did n't have E6694 E93 on to rebut /.  [SEP]  now the former director of the federal bureau of investigation uh who ca n't stand E6074 clearly writes a book gets one segment for [his] book /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  and you cry foul /.  [SEP]  nobody was complaining about when E5515 E6074 was getting all this airtime on cbs /.  [SEP]  look /.  [SEP]  look this is a program about good journalism /.  [SEP]  let 's ask a sixty minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former fbi director as whether it 's true or not /.  [SEP]  is it good enough to air it just because [he] says it /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  but uh do you feel it 's getting the attention that it should /?  [SEP]  yeah /.  [SEP]  no because to me this is the whole ballgame of the bush administration /.  [SEP]  E6771 and E934 they 'll come and go /.  [SEP]  but at the end of the day the bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /.  [SEP]  if that happens then i think president bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in [his] uh legacy there /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  here 's what you learn when you go to iraq /.  [SEP]  where you have an iraqi commander who 's a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit /.  [SEP]  and where you do n't have that commander you do n't have a unit /.  [SEP]  so the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.  [SEP]  so i went down to see the navy there /.  [SEP]  the navy of iraq has a terrific commander /.  [SEP]  so the people around [him] they 'll follow [him] into battle /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  and people are exhausted i think both viewers and reporters /.  [SEP]  ahead have new york times columnists been asked not to write about E5807 miller /?  [SEP]  more of my interview with E6408 friedman next /.  [SEP]  welcome back to reliable sources now a full hour each week here in our new time slot ten to eleven o'clock eastern /.  [SEP]  more now of my conversation with new york times columnist E6408 friedman about [his] book the new online charge to read [him] and E5807 miller /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  and i would argue a little bit that it got missed because of all these other distractions /.  [SEP]  but it 's only had an effect on E6408 friedman 's career /.  [SEP]  in fact you were the playboy interview /.  [SEP]  hey put that paper down /.  [SEP]  /.  [SEP]  i bought it for the articles /.  [SEP]  uh i enjoyed the interview /.  [SEP]  and you said in there that your wife uh edits all your columns and [she] says do n't publish it /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  yes [she] does /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  you go back and rewrite it /.  [SEP]  i 'm afraid i do /.  [SEP]  /.  [SEP]  my wife E1312 edits them all /.  [SEP]  and when [she] gives me thumbs down E2229 i have to put it in a ball throw it in the circular file and start over /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  and [she] 's a tough editor /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  and that 's my assistant /.  [SEP]  so um /-  [SEP]  did you even tell the boss /?  [SEP]  that 's right /. so there 's no edict out there /.  [SEP]  why people have n't written about it i do n't know /.  [SEP]  i 'm focused on other things /.  [SEP]  there 's a lot we do n't know obviously about the E3991 miller situation /.  [SEP]  but why do you think that [she] has gotten so much criticism /?  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  after all whether you agree with [her] or not this is a woman who believed in [her] convictions and went off to jail for eighty - five days /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  when we come back one network up the river without an explanation /.  [SEP]  reporters are tired of the usual standups you know E3713 kurtz oshkosh wisconsin /.  [SEP]  they want to be riding on a train or walking in the rain or something to get attention /.  [SEP]  so when nbc 's E1614 kosinski was covering some flooding in new jersey for the today show friday [she] set out in a canoe /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  good morning /.  [SEP]  well obviously we 're getting a nice break from the rain but not the flooding /.  [SEP]  this is essentially now a part of the passaic river in this neighborhood /.  [SEP]  two guys walk into the shot /.  [SEP]  and we see that the water is only maybe four inches deep /.  [SEP]  talk about shallow reporting /.  [SEP]  and as the media research center pointed out this was right before the today show accused president bush of staging [his] conversation with soldiers in iraq /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  and in our meet the press minute former president E3129 E6138 turns ninety three this week /.  [SEP]  [he] last appeared as president on meet the press thirty one years ago when [he] talked about age as a state of mind /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  that does n't work for japan /.  [SEP]  it does n't work with south korea /.  [SEP]  and frankly it does n't work with the chinese /.  [SEP]  so i said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this chinese delegation going to /.  [SEP]  and E4168 E5331 our ambassador was in china a few days ago /.  [SEP]  [he] made the point and secretary E423 made the point yesterday to the chinese foreign minister  we want to see china use its influence /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  we want to see china push forward and ask the north koreans to meet these commitments that they 've made to all of us /.  [SEP]  speaker newt gingrich the former speaker republican weighed in on this debate in this way /.  [SEP]  [he] offered this /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  the group says that by two thousand eight north korea could have enough plutonium for eight to seventeen nuclear weapons /.  [SEP]  the group 's assessment based on analysis of satellite imagery media reports and statements by north korean officials which lead E5941 everstat a conservative critic from the american enterprise institute these are not democrats /-  [SEP]  [he] offered this /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  although the bush administration 's rhetoric about E6774 jong - il and [his] regime has sometimes seemed ferocious north korea 's leaders seem to have concluded that the bush north korea policy consists mainly of empty words and that oft repeated warning need not be taken terribly seriously /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  since the president uttered those words mister ambassador every estimate is that north korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons /.  [SEP]  and yet we 've driven forward with this policy designed to respond to all the things the president talked about back in two thousand two /.  [SEP]  but [he] has been very consistent since then in putting forward the proposition that we have to oppose the human rights abuses of the government /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  but again it 's the tone and the rhetoric /.  [SEP]  let me go back and review some of the things the president has said about E6774 jong - il of north korea /.  [SEP]  i loathe E6774 jong - il /.  [SEP]  i got a visceral reaction to this guy /.  [SEP]  and then in two thousand four there 's a tyrant in north korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon /.  [SEP]  and then this in two thousand two /.  [SEP]  the president called [him] a pygmy and compared [him] to a spoiled child at a dinner table /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  does the president still believe that E6774 jong - il is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /.  [SEP]  E6774 jong - il is a despot /.  [SEP]  and [he] is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over the world /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  and we 're focused on this nuclear question as well /.  [SEP]  so i think there 's been a lot of continuity over american policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we 've talked about north korea over the last several years /.  [SEP]  and uh we 're determined to press ahead /.  [SEP]  when the president talked about the axis of evil [he] said iraq north korea and iran /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  they thought that they could divide the united states from both our european allies and from russia and china /.  [SEP]  but we 've been able to craft a major and united coalition of all those countries /.  [SEP]  and we 've essentially given the iranians a clear choice /.  [SEP]  and you 'll see a lot of this unfold this week both in europe when secretary E423 meets with [her] counterparts on wednesday at the ga summit in st. petersburgh at the end of the week when the president is there /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  so i do n't agree at all that we 're somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over wmd in iraq /.  [SEP]  let me conclude with comments by E5515 E6698 the editor of weekly standard /.  [SEP]  [he] used to work for vice president E3819 quail /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  uh what you have is north korea has quadrupled its enriched plutonium since two thousand and two /.  [SEP]  uh the six party talks are going nowhere /.  [SEP]  we should talk directly to the north koreans to discuss what is next /.  [SEP]  they need to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.  [SEP]  they need to destroy their missile capability /.  [SEP]  the only way to do that in my judgment is face to face talks at a level of E5344 E5331 /.  [SEP]  [he] is a competent diplomat /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  a time table for north korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons /.  [SEP]  efforts to set up bench marks in exchange for that armistice agreement where we do n't attack north korea /.  [SEP]  they get economic assistance /.  [SEP]  but our objective should be firm /.  [SEP]  to get them to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.  [SEP]  the best way to do it is face to face talks /.  [SEP]  if the president now changed [his] course wo n't the headlines be bush blinks /?  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  no /.  [SEP]  i believe the headlines would be bush deals realistically with north korea /.  [SEP]  [he] reverses a policy that is not working /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  now i have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction also /.  [SEP]  you may say there 's risk in this action /.  [SEP]  but i have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction as well letting north korea go nuclear /.  [SEP]  governor richardson well how do you think the north koreans would react if we took out their test missile /?  [SEP]  well i respectfully disagree with assistant secretary E6107 there /.  [SEP]  but at least [he] 's got a new idea which the administration does not put forth /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  uh E6888 E6107 got uh an agreement which was later violated regrettably with the father E6774 jong - il /.  [SEP]  my point is that face to face discussions with the united states directly i believe is a precursor /.  [SEP]  the continuation of the six party talks is the best way to go /.  [SEP]  but do they keep their word /?  [SEP]  here 's E3912 albright toasting E6774 jong - il in north korea october of two thousand /.  [SEP]  [she] appeared on this program four years later /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  we can deter a country with ballistic missiles /.  [SEP]  we know the return address /.  [SEP]  we do /.  [SEP]  but with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against united airlines or american airlines or a bus or a truck /.  [SEP]  and deterrents does n't work terribly well when an enemy values your death more than [his] life /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  governor richardson draw a line in the stand and step back /.  [SEP]  the north koreans watch that /.  [SEP]  they observe that /.  [SEP]  they know what their own has been /.  [SEP]  how do you have any strength in negotiating with people like that /?  [SEP]  the north koreans in my dealings with them they care more about form than they do substance /.  [SEP]  in your earlier segment you showed president bush calling [him] a tyrant /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  but then later [he] called [him] mister E6774 jong - il /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  the only way to find out whether they 'll ultimately give up those weapons is to do a deal /.  [SEP]  we hear so much talk about E6774 jong - il tyrant spoiled child /.  [SEP]  others have said madman /.  [SEP]  you 've been in that country five times /.  [SEP]  who is [he] /?  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  what is [he] /?  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  well i 've never met [him] /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  i met the number two in command /.  [SEP]  [he] is the entire nation /.

[SEP]  a lot of people are starving there /.  [SEP]  they have human rights violations /.  [SEP]  [he] is a mercurial character /.  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  but i think [he] 's crazy like a fox /.  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [he] is not somebody that is uh out of [his] mind /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] may be totally unpredictable isolated /.  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  but [he] 's calculating /.

[SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] gets the nuclear inspectors out in two thousand and two /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  this is the way [he] operates /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  and what we should do is take advantage of [his] vulnerability /.  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] also is vulnerable in the sense that the country is weak economically /.

[SEP]', '[CLS]  the father went first  and later the mother wanted to go  too .  [SEP]  what happened to these two children ?  [SEP]  the grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas  grandparents also have to work in the field !  [SEP]  as a result   this mother sent  these brother and sister  to martial arts school to study .  [SEP]  after they went to the martial arts school for a while  um  their mother was  um  a little worried  so [she] went to visit them .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [she] went to visit them .

[SEP]', '[CLS]  you said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .  [SEP]  it is true .  [SEP]  it is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children .  [SEP]  however  for the elderly  with the difference in age and time   their  ways of taking care and loving the children are different .  [SEP]  they are influenced by their own habits .  [SEP]  for instance  there was a child who was sick .  [SEP]  um  the grandparents asked [him] to take  a small pill that was made in shaanxi .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible  they are influenced by  some habits in this aspect .  [SEP]   they raised this point themselves .  [SEP]  another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .  [SEP]   [her] father and mother are not home  so the entire family falls onto our shoulders  especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  so  all i can do is to feed [her] and make sure that [she] is not cold .   [SEP]', '[CLS]  you have seen many kinds of left - behind children .  [SEP]  was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ?  [SEP]   um  there was a child in ningxia whose name was yao zhengang .  [SEP]  this child  um  did not do exceptionally well in school .  [SEP]  what impressed me the most about [him] was that [he] really missed [his] parents .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] felt particularly lonely and especially wanted [his] father to come back .

[SEP]', '[CLS]  after [his] father learned that [he] was very sick  [he] ran back to the village right away .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  after [he] arrived at the village  [he] did not say anything  but to put [him] on [his] back and carry [him] to the town to see a doctor .

[SEP]', '[CLS]  when the doctor in the town took a look and told [him] that they were unable to cure the sickness  [he] carried the child to the county .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  when yao zhengang told us what happened  [he] said   my father had never bought me so many tasty foods before .

[SEP]  after i heard this incident  i particularly understood what was in the mind of yao zhengang 's father .  [SEP]  [he] might have felt especially guilty toward [his] child .

[SEP]', '[CLS]  therefore  i can feel that um  um  parents who work in the city also have no alternative .  [SEP]  they are forced into making such decisions .  [SEP]  um  there was also this child .  [SEP]  there was a child  a girl in xixiang county  shaanxi province .  [SEP]  um  when i asked   what do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ?  [she] did not answer .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [she] went home to get a small box .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  there was a small finger inside the box .  [SEP]  this was a very terrifying incident .  [SEP]  what was the small finger all about ?  [SEP]  what happened was that when [her] um  parents left to work in the city  [her] grandparents looked after [her] .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  they had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay .  [SEP]  when [she] went downstairs to play by herself  an accident happened .

[SEP]\", '[CLS]   before they went to work in the city  they could watch [her] and forbade [her] to go down to the cellar .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] had told [her] not to do that before .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  however  i said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control .  [SEP]  that was why [she] turned this way .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  most of the children 's parents are in the southern part of the country .  [SEP]  many people want to save some travel expenses and earn some more money  so it is very common for them not to return home for a year or two .  [SEP]  life is so vast .

[SEP]  that was when i missed my mother the most .  [SEP]  this is jiang beiwen 's favorite photo .

[SEP]  what do you talk about ?  [SEP]  i will talk about my studies and life .  [SEP]  my schoolwork was not quite good when i first came !

[SEP]\", \"[CLS]  the young man said  `` i have obeyed all these commands .  [SEP]  what else do i need ? ''  [SEP]  E1293 answered  `` if you want to be perfect  then go and sell all that you own .

''  [SEP]  but when the young man heard E1293 tell [him] to give away [his] money  [he] was sad .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  [he] did n't want to do this  because [he] was very rich .

[SEP]  they asked  `` then who can be saved ? ''  [SEP]  E1293 looked at them and said  `` this is something that people can not do .  [SEP]  but god can do anything . ''  [SEP]  E3520 said to [him]  `` we left everything we had and followed you .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  so what will we have ?

''  [SEP]  six days later  E1293 took E3520  E2691  and E719 and went up on a high mountain .  [SEP]  they were all alone there .  [SEP]  while these followers watched [him]  E1293 was changed .

''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  E1293 answered  `` they are right to say that E2279 must come first .  [SEP]  E2279 makes all things the way they should be .  [SEP]  but why do the scriptures say that the E5875 of man will suffer much and that people will think [he] is worth nothing ?  [SEP]', '[CLS]  i tell you that E2279 has already come .

[SEP]', '[CLS]  -lrb- this is how the jews bury people . -rrb-  [SEP]  in the place where E1293 was killed on the cross  there was a garden .  [SEP]  in the garden there was a new tomb .  [SEP]  no one had ever been buried there before .  [SEP]  the men put E1293 in that tomb because it was near  and the jews were preparing to start their sabbath day .  [SEP]  in jerusalem E7537 was still trying to scare the followers of the lord  even saying [he] would kill them .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] went to the high priest and asked [him] to write letters to the synagogues in the city of damascus .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  E7537 wanted the high priest to give [him] the authority to find people in damascus who were followers of the E2698 .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  if [he] found any believers there  men or women  [he] would arrest them and bring them back to jerusalem .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  so E7537 went to damascus .  [SEP]  when [he] came near the city  a very bright light from heaven suddenly shined around [him] .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to [him]  `` E7537  E7537 !  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  why are you persecuting me ? ''  [SEP]  E7537 said  `` who are you  lord ? ''  [SEP]  the voice answered  `` i am E1293  the one you are persecuting .  [SEP]  get up now and go into the city .  [SEP]  someone there will tell you what you must do . ''  [SEP]  the men traveling with E7537 just stood there  unable to speak .  [SEP]  they heard the voice  but they saw no one .  [SEP]  E7537 got up from the ground and opened [his] eyes  but [he] could not see .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  so the men with [him] held [his] hand and led [him] into damascus .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  for three days E7537 could not see ; [he] did not eat or drink .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  there was a follower of E1293 in damascus named ananias .  [SEP]  in a vision the lord said to [him]  `` ananias ! ''  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  ananias answered  `` here i am  lord . ''  [SEP]  the lord said to [him]  `` get up and go to the street called straight street .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  find the house of E474 and ask for a man named E7537 from the city of tarsus .  [SEP]  [he] is there now  praying .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  [he] has seen a vision in which a man named ananias came and laid [his] hands on [him] so that [he] could see again . ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  but ananias answered  `` lord  many people have told me about this man .  [SEP]  they told me about the many bad things [he] did to your holy people in jerusalem .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  now [he] has come here to damascus .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  the leading priests have given [him] the power to arrest all people who trust in you . ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  but the lord E1293 said to ananias  `` go !  [SEP]  i have chosen E7537 for an important work .  [SEP]  [he] must tell about me to other nations and their rulers and to the people of E7074 .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  i will show [him] all that [he] must suffer for me . ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  so ananias left and went to the house of E474 .  [SEP]  [he] laid [his] hands on E7537 and said  `` E7537  my brother  the lord E1293 sent me .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] is the one you saw on the road when you came here .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  [he] sent me so that you can see again and also be filled with the holy spirit . ''  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  immediately  something that looked like fish scales fell off E7537 's eyes .  [SEP]  [he] was able to see !  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  then [he] got up and was baptized .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  after [he] ate  [he] began to feel strong again .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  E7537 stayed with the followers of E1293 in damascus for a few days .  [SEP]  soon [he] began to go to the synagogues and tell people about E1293 .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  [he] told the people  `` E1293 is the E5875 of god ! ''  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  all the people who heard E7537 were amazed .  [SEP]  they said  `` this is the same man who was in jerusalem trying to destroy the people who trust in E1293 !  [SEP]  and that 's why [he] has come here -- to arrest the followers of E1293 and take them back to the leading priests . ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  but E7537 became more and more powerful in proving that E1293 is the E2839 .  [SEP]  [his] proofs were so strong that the jews who lived in damascus could not argue with [him] .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  after many days  some jews made plans to kill E7537 .  [SEP]  they were watching the city gates day and night .  [SEP]  they wanted to kill E7537  but [he] learned about their plan .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  one night some followers that E7537 had taught helped [him] leave the city .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  they put [him] in a basket and lowered it down through a hole in the city wall .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  then E7537 went to jerusalem .  [SEP]  [he] tried to join the group of followers  but they were all afraid of [him] .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  they did not believe that [he] was really a follower of E1293 .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  but E5120 accepted E7537 and took [him] to the apostles .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] told them how E7537 had seen the lord on the road and how the lord had spoken to E7537 .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  then [he] told them how boldly E7537 had spoken for the lord in damascus .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  and so E7537 stayed with the followers and went all around jerusalem speaking boldly for the lord .  [SEP]  [he] often had arguments with the greek - speaking jews  who began making plans to kill [him] .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  when the believers learned about this  they took E7537 to caesarea  and from there they sent [him] to the city of tarsus .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  the church in judea  galilee  and E3752 had a time of peace .  [SEP]  with the help of the holy spirit  the groups of believers became stronger and showed their respect for the lord by the way they lived .  [SEP]  so the church everywhere grew in numbers .  [SEP]  E3520 was traveling through all the areas around jerusalem  and [he] stopped to visit the believers who lived in lydda .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  there [he] met a man named aeneas  who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for the past eight years .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  E3520 said to [him]  `` aeneas  E1293 E2839 heals you .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  get up and make your bed ! ''  [SEP]  [he] stood up immediately .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  all the people living in lydda and on the plain of E2217 saw [him]  and they decided to follow the lord .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  in the city of joppa there was a follower of E1293 named E3308 .  [SEP]  [her] greek name  E1185  means `` a deer . ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [she] was always doing good things for people and giving money to those in need .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  while E3520 was in lydda  E3308 became sick and died .  [SEP]  they washed [her] body and put it in an upstairs room .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  the followers in joppa heard that E3520 was in lydda  which was not far away .  [SEP]  so they sent two men  who begged [him]  `` hurry  please come quickly ! ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  E3520 got ready and went with them .  [SEP]  when [he] arrived  they took [him] to the upstairs room .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  all the widows stood around [him] .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  they were crying and showing [him] the coats and other clothes that E3308 had made during [her] time with them .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  E3520 sent all the people out of the room .  [SEP]  [he] knelt down and prayed .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  then [he] turned to E3308 's body and said  `` E3308  stand up ! ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [she] opened [her] eyes .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  when [she] saw E3520  [she] sat up .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] gave [her] [his] hand and helped [her] stand up .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  then [he] called the believers and the widows into the room .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] showed them E3308 ; [she] was alive !  [SEP]', '[CLS]  people everywhere in joppa learned about this  and many believed in the lord .  [SEP]  E3520 stayed in joppa for many days at the home of a man named E564  who was a leatherworker .  [SEP]  while apollos was in the city of corinth  E2138 was visiting some places on [his] way to ephesus .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  in ephesus [he] found some other followers of the lord .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  [he] asked them  `` did you receive the holy spirit when you believed ? ''  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  these followers said to [him]  `` we have never even heard of a holy spirit ! ''  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  E2138 asked them  `` so what kind of baptism did you have ? ''  [SEP]  they said  `` it was the baptism that E719 taught . ''  [SEP]  E2138 said  `` E719 told people to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives .  [SEP]  [he] told people to believe in the one who would come after [him]  and that one is E1293 . ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  when these followers heard this  they were baptized in the name of the lord E1293 .  [SEP]  then E2138 laid [his] hands on them  and the holy spirit came on them .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  they began speaking different languages and prophesying .  [SEP]  there were about twelve men in this group .  [SEP]  E2138 went into the synagogue and spoke very boldly .  [SEP]  [he] continued doing this for three months .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  [he] talked with the jews  trying to persuade them to accept what [he] was telling them about god 's kingdom .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  but some of them became stubborn and refused to believe .  [SEP]  in front of everyone  they said bad things about the E2698 .  [SEP]  so E2138 left these jews and took the lord 's followers with [him] .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [he] went to a place where a man named tyrannus had a school .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  there E2138 talked with people every day .  [SEP]  [he] did this for two years .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  the seven sons of sceva  one of the leading priests  were doing this .  [SEP]  these jews tried to use the name of the lord E1293 to make the evil spirits go out of people .  [SEP]  they all said  `` by the same E1293 that E2138 talks about  i order you to come out ! ''  [SEP]  but one time an evil spirit said to these jews  `` i know E1293  and i know about E2138  but who are you ? ''  [SEP]  then the man who had the evil spirit inside [him] jumped on these jews .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [he] was much stronger than all of them .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] beat them up and tore their clothes off .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  some of them had used magic .  [SEP]  these believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone .  [SEP]  these books were worth about 50  000 silver coins .  [SEP]  this is how the word of the lord was spreading in a powerful way  causing more and more people to believe .  [SEP]  after this  E2138 made plans to go to jerusalem .  [SEP]  [he] planned to go through the regions of macedonia and achaia  and then go to jerusalem .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  [he] thought  `` after i visit jerusalem  i must also visit rome . ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  E5637 and E2927 were two of [his] helpers .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  E2138 sent them ahead to macedonia .  [SEP]  but [he] stayed in E3336 for a while .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  but during that time there was some trouble in ephesus about the E2698 .  [SEP]  this is how it all happened : there was a man named E4123 .  [SEP]  [he] worked with silver .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess artemis .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  the men who did this work made a lot of money .  [SEP]  E4123 had a meeting with these men and some others who did the same kind of work .  [SEP]  [he] told them  `` men  you know that we make a lot of money from our business .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  but look at what this man E2138 is doing .  [SEP]  listen to what [he] is saying .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] has convinced many people in ephesus and all over E3336 to change their religion .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] says the gods that people make by hand are not real .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  i 'm afraid this is going to turn people against our business .  [SEP]  but there is also another problem .  [SEP]  people will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess artemis is not important .  [SEP]  [her] greatness will be destroyed .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  and artemis is the goddess that everyone in E3336 and the whole world worships . ''  [SEP]  when the men heard this  they became very angry .  [SEP]  they shouted  `` great is artemis  the goddess of ephesus ! ''  [SEP]  the whole city was thrown into confusion .  [SEP]  the people grabbed gaius and aristarchus  men from macedonia who were traveling with E2138  and rushed all together into the stadium .  [SEP]  E2138 wanted to go in and talk to the people  but the lord 's followers did not let [him] go .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  also  some leaders of the country who were friends of E2138 sent [him] a message telling [him] not to go into the stadium .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  some people were shouting one thing and others were shouting something else .  [SEP]  the meeting was very confused .  [SEP]  most of the people did not know why they had come there .  [SEP]  some jews made a man named E2734 stand before the crowd  and they told [him] what to say .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  E2734 waved [his] hand  trying to explain things to the people .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  but when the people saw that E2734 was a jew  they all began shouting the same thing .  [SEP]  for two hours they continued shouting  `` great is artemis of ephesus !  [SEP]  great is artemis of ephesus !  [SEP]  great is artemis . . . ! ''  [SEP]  then the city clerk persuaded the people to be quiet .  [SEP]  [he] said  `` men of ephesus  everyone knows that ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess artemis .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  everyone knows that we also keep [her] holy rock .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  no one can deny this  so you should be quiet .  [SEP]  you must stop and think before you do anything else .  [SEP]  `` you brought these men here  but they have not said anything bad against our goddess .  [SEP]  they have not stolen anything from [her] temple .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  we have courts of law and there are judges .  [SEP]  do E4123 and those men who work with [him] have a charge against anyone ?  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  they should go to the courts .  [SEP]  let them argue with each other there .  [SEP]  `` is there something else you want to talk about ?  [SEP]  then come to the regular town meeting of the people .  [SEP]  it can be decided there .  [SEP]  i say this because someone might see this trouble today and say we are rioting .  [SEP]  we could not explain all this trouble  because there is no real reason for this meeting . ''  [SEP]  after the city clerk said this  [he] told the people to go home .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  i have great sorrow and always feel much sadness for my own people .  [SEP]  they are my brothers and sisters  my earthly family .  [SEP]  i wish i could help them .  [SEP]  i would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from E2839 if that would help them .  [SEP]  they are the people of E7074  god 's chosen children .  [SEP]  they have the glory of god and the agreements [he] made between himself and [his] people .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  god gave them the law of E5222  the E4971 worship  and [his] promises .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  they are the descendants of our great fathers  and they are the earthly family of E2839 .  [SEP]  and E2839 is god over all things .  [SEP]  praise [him] forever !  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  amen .  [SEP]  i do n't mean that god failed to keep [his] promise to the jewish people .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  but only some of the people of E7074 are really god 's people .  [SEP]  and only some of E6748 's descendants are true children of E6748 .  [SEP]  this is what god said to E6748 : `` your true descendants will be those who come through E3372 . ''  [SEP]  this means that not all of E6748 's descendants are god 's true children .  [SEP]  E6748 's true children are those who become god 's children because of the promise [he] made to E6748 .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  here is what god said in that promise : `` about this time next year i will come back  and E990 will have a son . ''  [SEP]  and that is not all .  [SEP]  E3594 also had sons  and they had the same father .  [SEP]  [he] is our father E3372 .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  but before the two sons were born  god told E3594  `` the older son will serve the younger . ''  [SEP]  this was before the boys had done anything good or bad .  [SEP]  god said this before they were born so that the boy [he] wanted would be chosen because of god 's own plan .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [he] was chosen because [he] was the one god wanted to call  not because of anything the boys did .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  as the scriptures say  `` i loved E5804  but i hated E4404 . ''  [SEP]  so what does this mean ?  [SEP]  that god is not fair ?  [SEP]  we can not say that .  [SEP]  god said to E5222  `` i will show mercy to anyone i want to show mercy to .  [SEP]  i will show pity to anyone i choose . ''  [SEP]  so god will choose anyone [he] decides to show mercy to  and [his] choice does not depend on what people want or try to do .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  in the scriptures god says to pharaoh : `` i made you king so that you could do this for me .  [SEP]  i wanted to show my power through you .  [SEP]  i wanted my name to be announced throughout the world . ''  [SEP]  so god shows mercy to those [he] wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those [he] wants to make stubborn .  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  so one of you will ask me  `` if god controls what we do  why does [he] blame us for our sins ? ''  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  do n't ask that .  [SEP]  you are only human and have no right to question god .  [SEP]  a clay jar does not question the one who made it .  [SEP]  it does not say  `` why did you make me like this ? ''  [SEP]  the one who makes the jar can make anything [he] wants .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  [he] uses the same clay to make different things .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  it is the same way with what god has done .  [SEP]  [he] wanted to show [his] anger and to let people see [his] power .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  but [he] patiently endured those [he] was angry with -- people who were ready to be destroyed .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] waited with patience so that [he] could make known the riches of [his] glory to the people [he] has chosen to receive [his] mercy .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  god has already prepared them to share [his] glory .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  and E6469 cries out about E7074 : `` there are so many people of E7074  they are like the grains of sand by the sea .  [SEP]  but only a few of them will be saved .  [SEP]  yes  the lord will quickly finish judging the people on the earth . ''  [SEP]  it is just as E6469 said : `` the lord all - powerful allowed some of our people to live .  [SEP]  if [he] had not done that  we would now be like sodom  and we would be like gomorrah . ''  [SEP]\", \"[CLS]  they failed because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did .  [SEP]  they did not trust in god to make them right .  [SEP]  they fell over the stone that makes people fall .  [SEP]  the scriptures talk about that stone : `` look  i put in zion a stone that will make people stumble .  [SEP]  it is a rock that will make people fall .

[SEP]  yes  it is written in the law of E5222 : ``  [SEP]  when a work animal is being used to separate grain  do n't keep it from eating the grain . ''  [SEP]  when god said this  was [he] thinking only about work animals ?  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  no .  [SEP]  [he] was really talking about us .

[SEP]  they will praise [him] because you are following the message about E2839 -- the message you say you believe .

[SEP]', \"[CLS]  above the box were the cherub angels that showed god 's glory .  [SEP]  these cherub angels were over the place of mercy .  [SEP]  but we can not say everything about this now .  [SEP]  everything in the tent was made ready in the way i have explained .  [SEP]  then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties .  [SEP]  but only the high priest could go into the second room  and [he] went in only once a year .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  also  [he] could never enter that room without taking blood with [him] .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] offered that blood to god for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinning .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  this is an example for us today .  [SEP]  it shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to god are not able to make the consciences of the worshipers completely clear .  [SEP]  these gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings .  [SEP]  they are only rules about the body .  [SEP]  god gave them for [his] people to follow until the time of [his] new way .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  but E2839 has already come to be the high priest .  [SEP]  [he] is the high priest of the good things we now have .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  but E2839 does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in .  [SEP]  [he] serves in a better place .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  unlike that tent  this one is perfect .  [SEP]  it was not made by anyone here on earth .  [SEP]  it does not belong to this world .  [SEP]  E2839 entered the most holy place only one time -- enough for all time .  [SEP]  [he] entered the most holy place by using [his] own blood  not the blood of goats or young bulls .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] entered there and made us free from sin forever .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship .  [SEP]  the blood and ashes made them pure again -- but only their bodies .  [SEP]  so surely the blood sacrifice of E2839 can do much more .  [SEP]  E2839 offered himself through the eternal spirit as a perfect sacrifice to god .  [SEP]  [his] blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  it will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living god .  [SEP]  so E2839 brings a new agreement from god to [his] people .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by god can have the blessings god promised  blessings that last forever .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  this can happen only because E2839 died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement .  [SEP]  when someone dies and leaves a will  there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead .  [SEP]  a will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living .  [SEP]  it can be used only after that person 's death .  [SEP]  that is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between god and [his] people .  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  first  E5222 told the people every command in the law .  [SEP]  then [he] took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water .  [SEP]', '[CLS]  [he] used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people .  [SEP]', \"[CLS]  then [he] said  `` this is the blood that makes the agreement good -- the agreement that god commanded you to follow . ''  [SEP]\", '[CLS]  in the same way  E5222 sprinkled the blood on the holy tent .  [SEP]  [he] sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship .
